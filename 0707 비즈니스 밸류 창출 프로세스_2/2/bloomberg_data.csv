0,Obama¡¯s Plan for Automakers Gets Mixed Reviews on Capitol Hill,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 30 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama¡¯s steps to force a restructuring by U.S. automakers drew a mixed reaction from members of Congress, with some Republicans criticizing the forced resignation of General Motors Corp. Chief Executive Richard Wagoner.
Lawmakers from Michigan, Ohio and other states with economies dependent on the industry said they hoped that the plan, while tough, could help GM and Chrysler LLC avoid bankruptcy.
¡°It¡¯s not the favored option,¡± Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, told reporters of bankruptcy. A bankruptcy carries risks such as making consumers more unwilling to buy vehicles, he said.
Levin also said the president ¡°is absolutely committed to this industry¡± and helping it avoid bankruptcy.
The president briefed some House and Senate lawmakers by phone last night as news broke that he had forced the resignation of Wagoner. White House aides briefed a larger number of lawmakers and staff by phone about an hour later, at 8:30 p.m. Washington time.
Senator George V. Voinovich, an Ohio Republican and co-chairman of the Senate Auto Caucus, gave Obama credit for insisting on tougher reforms, calling them ¡°long overdue.¡±
¡°I am hoping the administration will be unrelenting in pushing GM to make the hard decisions necessary to achieve viability,¡± Voinovich said in a written statement.
¡°Next to divorce, bankruptcy is the worst thing you can get into,¡± Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said in an interview.
GM Bondholders
GM¡¯s bondholders must agree to restructure the company¡¯s debt to avert bankruptcy, said Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat. ¡°Any talk of bankruptcy needs to put pressure on bondholders to come to the table,¡± Levin said in an interview.
Obama today rejected recovery plans submitted by GM and Chrysler, saying they were too short on cost-cutting to ensure a turnaround to profitability. He gave the companies deadlines to ¡°fundamentally restructure¡± or lose the government aid that has kept them alive during the worst auto market in 27 years.
Obama gave GM, the biggest U.S. automaker, 60 days to develop a new strategy, and said Chrysler has 30 days to complete a partnership with Italy¡¯s Fiat SpA. The president also called upon company creditors, shareholders, workers, dealers and suppliers to make more sacrifices.
GM and Chrysler have received $17.4 billion in aid since December and have been trying to pare debt, payroll and health-care costs to win $21.6 billion in more assistance.
Tax Credits
Obama endorsed a proposal to grant tax credits to new car purchasers and to people who scrap their older, more-polluting vehicles.
Representative Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, dismissed the idea, saying he was ¡°sick and tired of talking about tax credits.¡±
The administration demanded the resignation of GM¡¯s Wagoner as a condition for continued support.
¡°We cannot continue to excuse poor decisions¡± and ¡°cannot make the survival of our auto industry dependent on an unending flow of taxpayer dollars,¡± Obama said today.
The ouster of Wagoner drew criticism from Republicans. Representative Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan called it ¡°the wrong move¡± for a company trying to dodge bankruptcy.
¡°Why would you want that chaos at the top of the corporation?¡± McCotter said on Bloomberg Television.
¡®A Sideshow¡¯
Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, called Wagoner¡¯s departure ¡°a sideshow¡± and said the administration hasn¡¯t made enough progress toward aiding the automaker.
¡°The administration is hoping the media and the public will stay focused on Wagoner and fail to notice that negotiations have not progressed since December,¡± Corker said in a written statement.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate¡¯s top Republican, said U.S. automakers repeatedly have failed to live up to their promises.
¡°It¡¯s clear that management, unions and investors have not yet produced viable plans that would allow the companies to survive without massive infusions of taxpayer dollars,¡± McConnell said in a written statement. ¡°How many times do the taxpayers have to provide bailout money on the promise of reform?¡±

1,Citigroup Says Malaysian Stocks Looking Attractive,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
(Adds quote in second paragraph, rating changes from seventh paragraph.)
By Chan Tien Hin
April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Malaysia's stocks are ``bottoming out'' and investors should buy property shares such as SP Setia Bhd. and UEM World Bhd. as the government may introduce measures this year to bolster consumer confidence, said Citigroup Inc.
``We see buying activities picking up imminently,'' Choong Wai Kee, a Citigroup analyst in Kuala Lumpur said in a report today. The August 2009 budget ``could stir buying interest as investors expect an expansionary budget.''
The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index has fallen 13 percent this year as global investor confidence has been dented by subprime-related crises in credit markets, and after the government suffered its worst election result in almost 50 years.
Choong set his yearend target for the benchmark stock index at 1,449.00. The gauge was at 1,260.4 at 11:25 a.m. local time. Citigroup ranked second in Asia in a 2007 investor poll by Institutional Investor magazine.
Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi last month vowed to proceed with infrastructure projects to promote growth and pledged measures to help the poor, seeking to reassure investors after the government's narrow poll victory.
The benchmark index on March 10 plunged 9.5 percent, its biggest drop in a decade, after opposition parties won almost half the states in the March 8 election and denied the ruling coalition a two-thirds majority in parliament for the first time since 1969. The electoral losses sparked investor concerns a weakened government would delay spending plans.
Rating Upgrade
Citigroup raised its rating on UEM World Bhd., a state-controlled builder that's developing Malaysia's largest property project, to ``buy'' from ``hold.'' It added SP Setia and KLCC Property Bhd. to its ``buy list.''
Investors should also buy palm oil shares such as IOI Corp. and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd., while small- to mid-cap stocks such as SapuraCrest Bhd. and TA Enterprise Bhd. should ``deliver strong price performance,'' Choong said in the report.
``We see value emerging'' in the property stocks, Choong said. ``Malaysia is now trading at discounts relative to the region and its historical valuation benchmarks.''
Malaysia's stock index is valued at 13.5 times estimated earnings, lower than the MSCI Asia Pacific Index's 14.3 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
On April 7, Citigroup cut its estimates for Malaysia's 2008 corporate earnings for the third time since October to reflect lower forecast profit for Tenaga Nasional Bhd., the nation's largest power utility."
2,"Shenhua, Astra Among 10 Asia Stocks Tipped by Goldman to Double","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
China Shenhua Energy Co. and PT Astra International are among 10 Asian stocks likely to double within three years because of higher profit growth and stronger balance sheets, Goldman, Sachs & Co. said.
The shares have fallen by an average 46 percent from their 52-week highs and have ``attractive'' valuations relative to their 10-year history, Goldman Sachs's Hong Kong analysts including Paul Bernard wrote in a note to clients today. The shares were subject to ``indiscriminate selling'' in the global rout that drove a measure of Asian stocks outside Japan to the lowest in more than two years last week, the analysts said.
``We fully recognize the continued macro headwinds and concerns over corporate earnings,'' they wrote. ``This report does not try to minimize the significance of these near-term pressures but aims to look beyond them to stock ideas that assume `normalized' valuations and earnings over a two- to three-year period.''
The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index has declined 32 percent this year as the global credit crisis dragged on economic growth and corporate profits worldwide. Shares on the index are valued at an average of 11.9 times reported profit, compared to 19.2 times on Oct. 29, when the index closed at a record, according to Bloomberg data.
Shares of China Shenhua, the country's biggest coal producer, may climb because the nation is short of energy, coal is ``under-priced,'' and the government has more room to raise power tariffs, according to the Goldman report. Shenhua has declined 50 percent this year in Hong Kong and trades at 15.8 times earnings.
Astra, Indonesia's biggest auto retailer, is similarly placed as it is a ``proxy for two of Indonesia's mega themes: strong secular domestic demand growth for cars and motorcycles and the booming commodity resources sector, mainly palm oil and coal mining,'' the note said. The Jakarta-based company's stock has fallen 32 percent this year, to 11.6 times profit.
The following is Goldman's list of stocks tipped to double in the next three years:
PT Astra International (ASII IJ)
Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB IN)
China Oilfield Services Ltd. (2883 HK)
China Shenhua Energy Co. (1088 HK)
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. (388 HK)

5,Italian Business Confidence Rises More Than Forecast,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Dec. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Italian business confidence rose for a second month after a recession eased in the third quarter and the nation¡¯s borrowing costs declined.
The manufacturing-sentiment index increased to 88.9 in December from 88.5 the previous month, Rome-based national statistics institute Istat said today. Economists had predicted a reading of 88.8, according to the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Separately, Italian borrowing costs stayed close to a two-year low at an auction of bills.
Italy¡¯s economy shrank 0.2 percent in the three months through September, about a third of the contraction recorded in the previous quarter. Still, the country¡¯s fourth recession since 2001 is now in its second year and this quarter is marked by a ¡°very negative context,¡± business lobby Confindustria said in a report last month.
Confidence is ¡°well short of the level required to herald an economic recovery in the first half of 2013,¡± said Raj Badiani, an economist at IHS Global Insight in London. While the improvement in the index indicates the economy is ¡°entering a less punishing phase,¡± it offers ¡°no hope of an emerging recovery phase.¡±
Today¡¯s report also showed that sentiment in building, services and retailing weakened this month. A gauge of services confidence dropped to 71.9 from 73.4, while a measure for retailers fell to 77.8 from 80.6. An index of overall economic sentiment fell to 75.4.
Debt Auction
Italy sold 8.5 billion euros ($11.3 billion) of 177-day bills today. The average yield was 0.949 percent, compared with 0.919 percent at the previous auction of similar-maturity debt on Nov. 28, which was the lowest since April 2010. Investors bid for 1.57 times the amount of bills offered.
The sale was the first since Prime Minister Mario Monti said on Dec. 23 that he would consider being a candidate for premier in the elections on Feb. 24-25.
Monti¡¯s announcement came weeks after former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi reversed a decision to stay out of the election, before offering to stand aside if Monti would lead a coalition of ¡°moderates.¡± Berlusconi is now campaigning against the Monti government.
Bond Yield
Italy returns to the market tomorrow with the sale of as much as 6 billion euros of five and 10-year bonds. The yield on the nation¡¯s 10-year debt rose 4 basis points to 4.51 percent today. It fell to 4.35 percent last week, the least since December 2010, helped by a European Central Bank pledge to safeguard the euro.
Elsewhere in Europe, the British Bankers¡¯ Association said U.K. mortgage approvals rose last month to the highest level since January, adding to signs of stabilization in the market. Lenders granted 33,634 approvals in November, up from 33,128 in October. Still, net mortgage lending rose by just 164 million pounds ($266 million) in November, the BBA said.
A gauge of Swiss consumer demand declined in November on a drop in new car registrations and a lower number of hotel stays by Swiss nationals. The index by UBS AG fell to 1.23 points from a revised 1.30 points in October.
In Asia, the Philippines intensified efforts to contain a surging peso, joining South Korea in clamping down on currency forward positions as monetary stimulus in the world¡¯s biggest developed economies spurs capital flows to Asia.
New Ceiling
The Southeast Asian nation imposed a ceiling for non-deliverable currency forwards for local lenders at 20 percent of capital, and 100 percent for foreign entities, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said yesterday. South Korea said in November it would tighten caps on currency forward positions at banks.
The peso is the best performer in Asia after the South Korean won this year as Philippine growth exceeding 7 percent last quarter lured investors seeking better returns amid interest rates near zero and monetary easing in Europe, the U.S. and Japan.
South Korea¡¯s government cut its 2013 growth forecast today, as Europe¡¯s debt crisis caps demand for exports. Gross domestic product will increase 3 percent, the Finance Ministry said, less than the 4 percent predicted in September.
Later today, U.S. data may show that purchases of new houses rose to the highest level in more than two years in November. New-home sales climbed to a 380,000 annual rate, the most since April 2010, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg before figures from the Commerce Department.
Figures from the Conference Board will show its confidence index fell to 70 in December from a more than four-year high of 73.7 the previous month, according to a separate poll.
A report yesterday showed home prices climbed more than forecast in October. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities increased 4.3 percent from a year earlier, exceeding the 4 percent gain forecast by economists.

6,$1.20 for Office Lunches as Errand Apps Bloom in India,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
(Bloomberg) -- When Harsh Vardhan Mandad and his Mumbai flat-mates brainstormed ideas for the next killer app, they fueled the sessions with late-night deliveries of local fare. The curry rice and spicy wraps inspired their big breakthrough.
They started Tiny Owl, a smartphone application that helps hungry city-dwellers scour nearby eateries for deliveries. The service now handles 2,000 orders each day and has caught the interest of venture funds including Sequoia Capital, an early backer of technology giants such as Apple Inc. and Oracle Corp.
India is becoming the land of the errand app. A growing number of startups cater to people who want to avoid the poor roads and polluted air, and can afford to do so because of the plentiful cheap labor. Almost anyone can use an app to have someone pick up groceries, drop off a letter at the post office or prepare a lunch that runs 75 rupees ($1.20) with delivery.
¡°People today want to do as much as possible with their phones,¡± said TinyOwl co-founder Mandad, who graduated from Mumbai¡¯s Indian Institute of Technology in 2012. ¡°It is a friction just to go out -- there¡¯s the heavy traffic, pollution and waiting involved for a cab.¡±
The startups are carving out niches by serving certain neighborhoods or parts of cities, realizing the ¡°hyper-local¡± strategy long envisioned in more developed countries including the U.S. Larger e-commerce companies such as Flipkart and Snapdeal dominate online sales of more traditional goods, including books, apparel and electronic goods.
Painful Driving
Need your bike serviced, your dry-cleaning picked up or even your own errand boy for a few hours? There are services for all that. There are also at least a dozen startups focused on food and grocery delivery, with angel investors and venture capital firms lining up to invest.
With traffic snarls in big Indian cities an everyday occurrence, it¡¯s common to find vehicles crawling along at less than 5 kilometers per hour on some Delhi roads, almost as slow as bullock carts, government data shows. Air quality is poor, with several cities faring worse than even Beijing.
All that has translated to fewer visitors in stores. People can get everything from apparel to groceries at the click of a button, said consultant Ashok Deenadayalu, who advises retailers on strategy and store management.
¡°Earlier it used to be a pastime to go to the malls on a weekend,¡± Deenadayalu, who¡¯s had a 24-year career at some of the nation¡¯s largest chains such as Reliance Retail, Bharti Wal Mart Pvt. and Metro AG. ¡°Now it¡¯s just a torture.¡±
Funding
Mandad¡¯s Tiny Owl raised $16 million from investors including Matrix Partners and Sequoia Capital in its second funding round in February, while grocer BigBasket.com got $32 million from private equity firms including Helion Venture Partners, the DealCurry.com financial blog reported last September. Meanwhile, European hedge funds and Singapore¡¯s Temasek Holdings Pte have also taken stakes in the bigger e-commerce companies.
Large fund houses have teams spread out across major Indian cities and that has helped them identify and invest in new ventures such as those in hyperlocal e-commerce, Venugopal Sathyanarayana, vice president at early-stage investor Orios Venture Partners, said in an e-mail today.
¡°These models have worked very well in the U.S. and hence the assumption is that they will work well in India too,¡± he said.
Size of Market
The size of the potential market in India makes it attractive for entrepreneurs to build businesses that are near-replicas of existing services in the West, and tweak them for Indian realities. Tiny Owl¡¯s model is similar to that of Chicago-based GrubHub Inc., while Yumist founder Alok Jain compares his service to Rocket Internet AG¡¯s EatFirst service that offers 7 pound ($10.60) lunches of coq au vin and other dishes to Londoners.
¡°In India, street food isn¡¯t hygienic and getting proper meals in the office is a huge pain,¡± said Jain, who used to work at Yelp Inc.¡¯s Indian competitor Zomato.com before starting his own venture. ¡°We¡¯re not in this to run a restaurant.¡±
The proliferation of food ordering apps can be a double edged sword for restaurants, Saloni Nangia, president at consultant Technopak Advisors said. It may lead to more business as eateries tap wider audiences, but negative reviews can easily dissuade walk-ins or online patrons.
Modern Twist
These companies put a modern, tech-enabled spin on a traditional food delivery service that has existed for more than a century in some Indian cities. For instance, Mumbai delivery men, known as dabba-walas, pick up home-cooked lunch boxes from about 130,000 households each morning, deliver them to the respective office workers by the afternoon, and then carry the empty containers back to the homes.
Each lunch box is picked up by a man in a bicycle or push cart, loaded on to local trains and then onward to buses or more push carts for the final hop to the recipient¡¯s office. Documentary films and a Harvard Business School case study have been devoted to this Mumbai institution, which traces its roots to 1890 when India was still a part of the British empire.
Yumist¡¯s service adds a twist to the tradition. With the press of a button in the app, customers can choose between two lunch options each morning and can opt out any day. Delivery men are typically in their 20s, wear uniforms and use their Android phones to manage orders.
Errand-boys
Another startup called GetMyPeon found its niche helping time strapped corporate executives deposit checks or pick up flower bouquets. The Mumbai-based company provides a concierge service that offers English-speaking, Android phone-totting, errand-boys on demand, who undertake all kinds of tasks that involve going somewhere within the city.
¡°People come to us with all kinds of requests; someone wants a bill paid, another left his iPhone charger at a friend¡¯s party and wants us to pick it up,¡± said Bharat Ahirwar, who started the service in 2012 and now has about 2,000 customers in the city.
These services aren¡¯t without their challenges, and some pay little attention to customer service, said Shrutin Shetty, founder of A-Team Business Consulting which advises startups on growth strategy.
¡°Companies need to realize that a beautiful app or interface is not enough,¡± Shetty said. ¡°It¡¯s the back end that matters.¡±
They should have sufficient employees and train them well to minimize consumer complaints and ensure punctual delivery, he said.
For Mumbai resident Pooja Dadlani, the profusion of smartphone apps has helped her outsource time-consuming errands and focus more on her consulting business.
¡°I use apps for everything; it¡¯s just so convenient,¡± said Dadlani, a public relations consultant for luxury brands. ¡°I¡¯d love for more such apps to help outsource more of my menial work.¡±

7,"Moody's, S&P Defer Cuts on AAA Subprime, Hiding Loss","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 11 (Bloomberg) -- Even after downgrading almost 10,000 subprime-mortgage bonds, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service haven't cut the ones that matter most: AAA securities that are the mainstays of bank and insurance company investments.
None of the 80 AAA securities in ABX indexes that track subprime bonds meet the criteria S&P had even before it toughened ratings standards in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A bond sold by Deutsche Bank AG in May 2006 is AAA at both companies even though 43 percent of the underlying mortgages are delinquent.
Sticking to the rules would strip at least $120 billion in bonds of their AAA status, extending the pain of a mortgage crisis that's triggered $188 billion in writedowns for the world's largest financial firms. AAA debt fell as low as 61 cents on the dollar after record home foreclosures and a decline to AA may push the value of the debt to 26 cents, according to Credit Suisse Group.
``The fact that they've kept those ratings where they are is laughable,'' said Kyle Bass, chief executive officer of Hayman Capital Partners, a Dallas-based hedge fund that made $500 million last year betting lower-rated subprime-mortgage bonds would decline in value. ``Downgrades of AAA and AA bonds are imminent, and they're going to be significant.''
Holding Capital
Bass estimates most of AAA subprime bonds in the ABX indexes will be cut by an average of six or seven levels within six weeks.
The 20 ABX indexes are the only public source of prices on debt tied to home loans that were made to subprime borrowers with poor credit histories. About $650 billion of subprime bonds are still outstanding, according to Deutsche Bank. About 75 percent were rated AAA at issuance.
Regulators require banks to hold more capital against lower-rated securities to protect against losses; a downgrade would force them either to sell the securities or bolster reserves. While most banks haven't disclosed the ratings of their subprime holdings, S&P estimated in January that losses on the debt may exceed $265 billion. American International Group Inc., the world's largest insurer, has $20.8 billion invested in AAA rated subprime-mortgage debt, not including asset-backed securities that caused the company's biggest-ever quarterly loss last period, according to the New York-based company's disclosures.
Credit Support
S&P and Moody's, the two biggest rating companies, are lagging behind Fitch Ratings, their smaller competitor. S&P, owned by McGraw-Hill Cos., and Moody's, a unit of Moody's Corp., have cut a combined 112 AAA ratings since July, about a quarter of Fitch's 390, according to Bloomberg data. S&P lowered one AAA bond in an ABX index, Moody's refrained altogether, and Fitch cut 19.
``We have built in 20 percent more home price declines from the end of '07,'' said Glenn Costello, managing director for residential mortgage-backed securities at Fitch. ``When you build in that much home price decline, I feel good when I pick up the paper and I see that home prices are only down another 3 percent. My ratings are still good.''
The ratings methods balance estimated losses against so-called credit support, a measure of how likely it is that owners of each piece of the bond will incur losses. For AAA rated debt, credit support needs to be five times the expected losses, according to Sylvain Raynes, author of The Analysis of Structured Securities, a college textbook.
Performance Testing
All but six of the 80 AAA ABX bonds failed an S&P test for investment-grade status, which requires credit support to be twice the percentage of troubled collateral. The guideline was one of four tests used by S&P used until last year, and a failure to meet the standard wouldn't have automatically resulted in a downgrade. The other companies used similar metrics to grade bonds, Raynes said.
Investment grade refers to all bonds rated BBB- and above by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's.
S&P and Moody's, both based in New York, failed to anticipate the record foreclosures on home loans and slumping house prices. New foreclosures jumped to 0.83 percent of all home loans in the fourth quarter, up from 0.54 percent a year earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association said March 6. Home prices fell 9 percent, the biggest decline in 20 years of record-keeping, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index.
Increasing Losses
As defaults on subprime loans increased, the three ratings companies increased their assumptions in the past six months for losses on the mortgages within the bonds and changed the computer models that predict declines in credit quality. S&P has twice increased its prediction for losses and is now forecasting as much as 19 percent for subprime bonds, compared with as little as 5 percent less than a year ago.
The companies began cutting in July and have since either downgraded or put on review a total of 38,000 subprime bonds, according to Bloomberg data. Moody's and S&P combined have downgraded more than 9,513 of the securities dating from 2005.
``We continue to monitor these securities, have placed many of them on CreditWatch negative, and will take additional action when, in our judgment, a rating action is warranted,'' said S&P spokesman Chris Atkins. ``We do not forbear or refrain from taking action for anyone else.''
Moody's, S&P and Fitch were all criticized by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers such as U.S. Senator Richard Shelby, who said they granted excessively high ratings on subprime-mortgage debt, then reacted too slowly when defaults reached record rates.
Reputation Damaged
``We said we would be taking more ratings action, and we will,'' said Claire Robinson, a senior managing director at Moody's in New York. ``We have to dig into the peculiarities of each deal because they're all different.''
Moody's cut its 2008 forecast for revenue and profit today, saying the slump in credit markets will go on longer than previously anticipated.
``I think our reputation has been hurt by what's been going on and it would be disingenuous of me to say it hadn't,'' Chief Executive Officer Raymond McDaniel told the Bear Stearns Cos. investor conference in Palm Springs, Florida. ``We are in a business where reputational capital is more important and this is of particular concern to me. That restoration of confidence is under way, not through marketing but through action.''
Rising Losses
The AAA securities included in the ABX are the most junior because they get repaid after other AAA securities from the same mortgage pools. The ABX is used by investors to place bets by buying credit-default swaps linked to the indexes. Credit-default swaps are financial instruments based on bonds and loans and used to speculate on a borrower's ability to repay debt. Contracts on asset-backed securities cover losses if the securities aren't repaid as expected, in return for regular insurance-like premiums.
Within one AAA index, the $79 million Deutsche Bank bond, known as ACE 2005-HE-7 A2D, is rated AAA by S&P and Moody's even though 18 percent of its loans are in foreclosure, 15 percent of the properties have been seized by lenders and about 10 percent have been delinquent for more than 90 days. When the bonds were created, Moody's and S&P required capital support to cover a loss rate of no more than 7 percent for all three loss categories combined. Fitch doesn't rate the debt.
On a $118 million Washington Mutual bond issued in 2007, WMHE 2007-HE2 2A4, 5.6 percent of its loans are in foreclosure and its safety margin, or the debt available to absorb losses, is less than the combined total of its loans at risk. Both S&P and Moody's rate it AAA.
Fitch rates that bond B, five levels below investment grade and 15 levels less than its rivals.
Years to Fix?
``It will take years for the ratings agencies to fix their problems,'' said Janet Tavakoli, president of Chicago-based Tavakoli Structured Finance. The firms are in a ``crisis of confidence,'' she said.
A $242 million Morgan Stanley Capital Inc. issue, the 2006-WMC2 A2D, has credit support of 64 percent relative to its delinquent mortgages, the lowest of any in the AAA index. The credit should be at least twice the delinquent mortgages. Moody's and S&P both give it the top rating. S&P is reviewing it for a downgrade and calculates that the pool will lose 24 percent of its collateral loan values. Fitch rates it BBB and said it may cut further.
The problem extends past the mortgage bonds. Financial firms own high-grade collateralized debt obligations, which package securities such as mortgage bonds and slice them into pieces with varying risk. As the underlying mortgage bonds are downgraded, those securities will also lose their ratings and tumble in value.
A bank would have to increase its capital against $100 million of bonds to $16 million from $1.6 million if a bond was downgraded to below investment grade from AAA, under global accounting rules.
`800-Pound Gorilla'
The bank would either have to sell the bonds at a loss or make up the difference in cash. Citigroup Inc., the largest U.S. bank, have already written down $19.9 billion of subprime mortgages and CDOs. Merrill Lynch & Co. cut its investments' value by $24.5 billion.
Bond insurers such as MBIA Inc. and Ambac Financial Group Inc. also have to hold more capital against insurance they write if the securities' credit quality declines.
The prospect of losses may be holding the ratings companies back, said Frank Partnoy, a University of San Diego law professor and former Morgan Stanley banker who has been writing about the impact of credit ratings companies since 1997.
``If the 800-pound gorilla moves, it's going to crush someone, so it's not going to want to move,'' Partnoy said. ``They know they will trigger a price collapse. They are understandably reluctant.''

Oct. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The French Laundry at Harrods, which opened on Saturday and lasts just 10 days, might politely be described as a phenomenon.
Hundreds are on the waiting list each day at this pop-up restaurant, the managers say, undeterred by a price tag of 250 pounds ($387) per person, plus service and wine. Throw in a generous serving of matching wines and your lunch bill for two may reach 805 pounds -- or $1,250 -- as mine did.
What do you get for your money? Ten courses of exquisite food prepared by Thomas Keller, one of the world¡¯s most respected chefs. He¡¯s brought over about 15 members of his team from the French Laundry, in Yountville, California. If you¡¯re familiar with his U.S. restaurants, you may spot staffers from Per Se, in New York, and from the various Bouchon outlets.
Harrods has constructed a special dining room on the fourth floor, with a version of the facade of the French Laundry. Diners eat from tableware that has also made the trip from the U.S., as have many of the ingredients. A booklet distributed to customers lists the suppliers, from Sterling Caviar of Sacramento, California, to the Chef¡¯s Garden, of Huron, Ohio.
It feels as though no expense has been spared, as you might expect at these prices. The restaurant conducted three practice services -- for friends and family, chefs and journalists -- before opening to the public on Oct. 1. I attended one of these meals on the night before the opening (for which diners weren¡¯t charged) and lunch on the first day, for which I paid.
Hartnett, Perry Lang
(I went along for the latter meal with chef Angela Hartnett and was impressed both with the dishes Keller sent out for her to try and with the fact he varied my menu so I wouldn¡¯t eat all the same things twice. I went to the preview with Adam Perry Lang, who is Jamie Oliver¡¯s partner at Barbecoa. Both chefs commented repeatedly on the quality of the cooking.)
The service was immaculate from start to finish, as if the French Laundry at Harrods had been running for years, the food brilliant. Keller, 55, was there in the kitchen, checking every dish -- I went in to take a look -- and only emerged into the dining room when everyone had been served.
The menu features several classic Keller concoctions, my favorite of which is Oysters and Pearls: a sabayon of pearl tapioca with oyster juice is served with Maldon oysters and Sterling White Sturgeon caviar. It¡¯s creamy and smoky and rich.
The menu alternates between indulgent treats and lighter dishes, such as the salad of Hawaiian hearts of peach palm, which contains Medjool date, young coconut, French Laundry garden carrots, red radish, and candied pili nuts.
Miniature Perfection
While this might not sound light -- it even contains a hint of Madras curry -- the radish is the smallest I have ever seen, about the size of a baby¡¯s fingernail, the carrot is shaved as thin as an ungenerous chef¡¯s white truffle. The elements are tiny, the whole harmonious as a barbershop quartet. It¡¯s perfection in miniature: bonsai gastronomy.
Other standouts include Poularde en Brioche, with Moulard duck foie gras, warm Sauternes jelly, Tokyo turnips, green apples and Perigord truffle coulis. A few of the courses play on classic dishes, such as chowder (with Sacramento River sturgeon, razor clams and sweet corn) and a peanut-butter dessert.
The dishes are imaginative without being pretentious and amusing without being silly. Their beauty is striking and the cooking of every element is faultless. Only a couple of ingredients detract from the perfection of the whole: the Maine lobster is an advertisement for the flavor of its Scottish cousin and the beauty of the beef (with black trumpet mushrooms, pumpkin and fennel) was mainly in the seasoning.
Michelin Stars
Keller is an outstanding and original chef who deserves all seven of the Michelin stars he holds, including three for the French Laundry, which won the World¡¯s Best Restaurant title in 2003 and 2004. The pop-up is a triumph for him and for Harrods.
It¡¯s an event that will be talked about in the culinary world for years to come. Eating there is like getting a ticket for the 100 Meters in the Olympic Games. (You can pay 725 pounds for that final in London.)
In that sense, dining there isn¡¯t about the cost, and if you want to go and can afford it and can get a reservation, you should go. But it is a pop-up and it just whetted my appetite for a first visit to the mothership in California.

10,$1.7 Trillion of Sub-Zero Euro Debt Shows ECB Outlook for 2016,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
As the European Central Bank wound down its asset purchases for the year, the amount of euro-region government bonds that yield less than zero was at about $1.68 trillion, indicating investors see the potential for further easing of monetary policy in 2016.
QuickTake Less Than Zero
With QE acquisitions set to resume on Jan. 4, bonds of governments from Portugal to Germany will be supported again by the 1.5 trillion-euro program, which is scheduled to keep running until at least March 2017.
Begun in March this year, the purchases continue to push an increasing number of securities off the table -- meaning their yields are so low they¡¯re ineligible for buying. The total issued value of bonds that yield less than the ECB¡¯s minus 0.3 percent deposit rate, and are thus deemed ineligible for acquisition by the ECB, is about $616 billion of the $6.35 trillion Bloomberg Eurozone Sovereign Bond Index.
A slump in oil prices is supporting economists¡¯ view that the ECB is unlikely to veer from its accommodative policy stance as it struggles to achieve its inflation goal of just under 2 percent, fulfilling a principal aim of the asset-purchase program.
So many sub-zero-yielding securities ¡°indicate that there is a belief that there is no real inflationary pressures evident yet, and the ECB will remain ready to do more if required,¡± said Owen Callan, a Dublin-based fixed-income strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP.
German two-year note yields were at minus 0.337 percent as of the 5 p.m. London close on Dec. 23. The price of the zero percent security due in December 2017 was 100.665 percent of face value. The last time the yield was positive was in August 2014.
With oil languishing near an 11-year low and the region¡¯s inflation a long way below the ECB¡¯s goal, Callan said ¡°crude oil is probably the leading indicator as regards to where ECB policy and where bond yields go in the start of 2016. That is what most of the markets are looking at the moment.¡±

11,China Freezes $1 Billion of Shares as Fund Boss Xu Probed,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
Chinese police have frozen $1 billion of shares in listed companies as authorities probe Xu Xiang, one of the nation¡¯s best-known hedge fund bosses, for alleged insider trading and stock manipulation.
In one of the latest moves, authorities slapped a two-year freeze on 90 million shares Xu¡¯s Zexi Investment holds in Shanghai-based developer Deluxe Family Co., according to a stock-exchange statement from Deluxe on Tuesday night. At yesterday¡¯s closing price, that stake was worth 1.16 billion yuan ($182 million.)
Xu, known in China as ¡°hedge fund brother No. 1,¡± is one of the targets in a wave of investigations as the government tries to assign blame and clean up the market after a summer stock rout. He was detained on the highway between Shanghai and Ningbo on Nov. 1, China National Radio reported.
In the eastern city of Ningbo, another firm also reported a lock-up, adding to restrictions earlier imposed on stakes held by Xu¡¯s mother, Zheng Suzhen. Zheng hasn¡¯t been named by the authorities as being under investigation. The total value of stakes frozen in four companies is $1 billion, based on Tuesday¡¯s closing prices.
More Freezes?
Shen Meng, a Beijing-based director at Chanson & Co., an investment bank, said that the numbers could get bigger, with more share freezes following as authorities continue their investigations.
No comment has been available from Xu, whose firm Zexi managed four of China¡¯s top-10 performing hedge funds between June and August, according to Shenzhen Rongzhi Investment Consultant Co. He couldn¡¯t be contacted on Wednesday through calls to his mobile phone number and to Zexi¡¯s offices in Shanghai and Beijing.
On Tuesday night, department-store firm Ningbo Zhongbai Co. told Shanghai¡¯s stock exchange that the police froze 35 million shares owned by Tibet Zetian Investment Development Co. Bloomberg was unable to contact Tibet Zetian through a telephone number listed on company registration records.
No Contact
In its statement, Ningbo Zhongbai also said that Ningbo Zhongbai¡¯s Chairman Xu Jun and a director of the company, Zhao Yibo, couldn¡¯t be contacted. On Nov. 3, Ningbo Zhongbai had said that it was unable to reach Chairman Xu and its controlling shareholder, Xu Boliang, to verify their personal connections with Xu Xiang.
Corruption checks are taking place across China¡¯s financial industry as the Communist Party¡¯s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection vets regulators, the nation¡¯s biggest banks, and sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corp. Those checks add to post-rout probes that have snared executives from Citic Securities Co., the nation¡¯s top brokerage, and a senior official at the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

12,$1 Coffees at 7-Eleven Fuel Japan¡¯s Surge Into the Java Big Leagues,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
The fastest-growing drinks market in Japan isn¡¯t craft beer or fruit smoothies. It¡¯s $1 cups of black coffee from the local 7-Eleven.
¡°Convenience-store coffee is just great, given its low price,¡± said Kiyoshi Fujimoto, a 50-year-old school teacher in Tokyo. He estimates he drinks coffee from the shops locally known as ¡°conbinis¡± four times as often as from Starbucks Corp., and pays about one-third of the price.
Coffee sales at convenience stores surged 48 percent last year, the fastest-growing part of Japan¡¯s beverage market, as $1-a-cup brews boosted consumption to a record. Japan is the world¡¯s biggest coffee importer after the U.S. and Germany. Demand per person will eventually be comparable to the U.S. and Europe, said Kazuyuki Kajiwara, general manager at the beverage department of trading company Marubeni Corp.
Bean and product imports reached 459,708 metric tons last year, according to roasters¡¯ group All Japan Coffee Association. The biggest suppliers are Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia, government data show. Consumption was an all-time high 449,908 tons last year, the coffee association said.
7-Eleven, which operates 17,600 convenience stores nationwide, plans to boost sales by 21 percent to 850 million cups for the year through February, according to Yasushi Kamata, a company director. FamilyMart Co., the third-biggest Japanese operator of convenience stores, aims to bolster brewed coffee sales 11 percent, said Natsu Takaoka, a spokeswoman.
Most Profitable
Starbucks opened in Japan in 1996, its first market outside North America, and now operates 1,100 stores across the country, James Olson, a spokesman for the Seattle-based company, said in an e-mail. Japanese stores are among its most-profitable, he said. Starbucks doesn¡¯t disclose how much coffee it purchases for or sells in Japan, Olson said. Tully¡¯s Coffee, also based in Seattle, has 588 stores in Japan, according to the company¡¯s website.
About 10 percent of Japan¡¯s bean imports supply convenience stores, with 7-Eleven representing about half of that volume, Kajiwara said. Lawson Inc., Japan¡¯s second-biggest operator of convenience stores, also brews coffee for sale at 100 yen (81 cents) a cup, the same as 7-Eleven and FamilyMart.
¡°Salarymen and housewives are saying that coffees at Starbucks¡± and other chain cafes are too expensive to buy everyday, said Akio Yoshizawa, deputy director of Lawson¡¯s merchandising division.
Japan¡¯s coffee demand is expected to grow by about 2 percent annually, said Kajiwara at Marubeni, which imports beans for 7-Eleven. Per-capita consumption will expand to 5 kilograms a year from 3.5 kilograms, he said.
¡®Conbinis¡¯ Coffee
¡°In my office, only instant coffee is available,¡± said Kiyoshi Fujimoto, a teacher in Tokyo. ¡®When I want to have a good coffee, I escape from the school to get it at a convenience store.¡¯¡¯
Coffee brewed by the stores expanded 48 percent in 2014 and sales are set to increase 17.3 percent to 175.9 billion yen this year, according to Fuji Keizai, a research group in Tokyo. Japan¡¯s total beverage market shrank 1.5 percent to 4.98 trillion yen in 2014, the researcher said in a May report.
It¡¯s not just demand for freshly brewed coffee that¡¯s increasing. About 100,000 tons of Japan¡¯s total coffee imports were used for production of instant coffee, and a similar amount was used to make canned coffee, according to Kajiwara at Marubeni. Coca-Cola Co.¡¯s Japanese unit and Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd. are the biggest makers of ready-to-drink canned coffee, sold mainly through vending machines.
¡°Convenience stores have created additional demand,¡± Marubeni¡¯s Kajiwara said. ¡°They are selling above-average coffee at the cheapest price in the world.¡±"

14,$1 Trillion Speaks Louder Than UN Talks,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
By Nathaniel Bullard
In the Facebook-inspired movie ""The Social Network,"" Justin Timberlake-as- Sean Parker memorably defines a meaningful amount of money: ¡°A million dollars isn¡¯t cool. You know what¡¯s cool? A billion dollars.¡±
In the energy world, you¡¯d better multiply all seemingly huge numbers by 1,000. A billion dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A trillion dollars. Here's why.
Sometime in the two weeks before the UN climate conference in Durban, the world passed $1 trillion mark in clean energy investment since 2004. That¡¯s a trillion dollars in solar and wind power plants, in bioenergy production facilities, in smart meters and smart grids, in assets, public markets, research and development.
Even for the energy world, it¡¯s a big number, and one that grew quickly. The world invested $52 billion in clean energy in 2004, and $243 billion last year. That¡¯s a 29 percent compound growth rate, sufficient for total yearly investment to double in less than three years. It¡¯s capital deployment that has increased every year even with tremendous macroeconomic headwinds and uncertain policies in Europe and the US. Last year¡¯s $243 billion is right about halfway to the yearly investment which Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates is necessary to slow climate change.
As important is where money is flowing. In 2004, that money was almost entirely European. When it came time for us to identify the trillionth dollar, we found that it went into a basket of projects all over the world: biomass in Brazil, wind in China, solar thermal in Morocco, electric vehicles in the US, even a solar system in Tonga. It is a global game now.
One of the analyst¡¯s tricks of the trade is the ability to make any number seem large or small. Here¡¯s how to make a trillion dollars seem small:Â  as we¡¯ve just added the seven billionth person to the world last month, we now have deployed $142.86 per person on earth into renewable energy.
That¡¯s 43.6 gallons of Regular Unleaded gasoline at today¡¯s national average prices.
That¡¯s 20.6 steak burritos at your favorite chain.
That¡¯s 1.4 30-day unlimited passes on the New York City subway system.
Can the world afford another trillion dollars in clean energy investment?Â  It will require some skillful unlocking of capital, and a great deal of coordination.Â  And even as energy ministers and the punditocracy cannot help but despair just a bit at the intractability of the climate negotiations process, a trillion dollars speaks louder than a UN plenary address.

Saturday¡¯s Kentucky Derby already has one guaranteed winner: The company that hosts the storied race will earn about $83 million for a spectacle that lasts a little more than two minutes.
Churchill Downs Inc. has seven casinos and tracks in the U.S., as well as its namesake property in Louisville. Yet the Run for the Roses will produce 30 percent of annual earnings, according to Cameron McKnight, a Wells Fargo Securities analyst. He estimates the race will generate record earnings this year, rising by $5 million, or 6 percent.
To keep profit climbing and entertain the 165,000 or so on hand for racing¡¯s biggest day, Churchill Downs has poured $180 million into the track since 2001. Three years ago, the company opened the Mansion, an area with its own entrance, chefs and 322 seats that average $10,000 each on Derby day. Other additions include a jumbo screen for grandstand fans and 20 finish-line boxes for horse owners.
¡°The Derby¡¯s importance extends far beyond the economic contribution,¡± William Carstanjen, Churchill Downs¡¯ chief executive officer, said in an interview. ¡°It remains the heartbeat of the company.¡±
Of the 20 horses scheduled for the May 2 race, American Pharoah is the favorite at 5-2, according to odds posted Thursday at KentuckyDerby.com, followed by Dortmund at 3-1. Both are trained by Bob Baffert. Secretariat holds the all-time speed record of 1:59:40 set in 1973.
The absence of an overwhelming favorite bodes well for betting since there will be ¡°less certainty and more theories,¡± Carstanjen said. ¡°Generally that¡¯s good for us.¡±
Racing Slowdown
The Derby is a bright spot for an industry that¡¯s been declining for years. Betting nationwide has shrunk by a third since 2003, to $10.6 billion last year from a peak of $15.2 billion, according to the Jockey Club, an industry group.
Tracks like Suffolk Downs, near Boston, and Hollywood Park, in Southern California, have dropped live racing or been razed, and the industry¡¯s biggest players, such as Churchill Downs and Penn National Gaming Inc., have expanded with casinos as the industry has declined.
Slightly more than half of the Derby¡¯s profit comes from premium ticket sales, according to McKnight. TV rights and sponsorships account for 23 percent, while betting is 16 percent. Food and beverages, including 120,000 mint juleps, the race¡¯s signature drink, amount to just 4 percent.
Attendance of 164,906 at the Derby last year was just shy of the 2012 record of 165,307. The race never sells out, Carstanjen said, as there¡¯s always room in the infield. The Derby dates back to the founding of the track in 1875.
Churchill Shares
Shares of Churchill Downs have tripled over the past five years as the company expanded into casinos and online games, and acquired additional tracks. That compares with about a 75 percent return for the Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 index.
Churchill Downs also owns TwinSpires, an online horse-betting business that produced $190 million in revenue last year. In December, the company paid $485 million for Big Fish Games Inc., a Seattle-based maker of mobile games such as Gummy Drop! and Big Fish Casino. That tab could reach $835 million if the business hits certain targets.
Employees of Big Fish Games will be in attendance at the Derby, Carstanjen said
¡°We hope that gets their creative juices flowing and they see some way to leverage our social and casual gaming business,¡± he said."
16,"$10 Trillion Later, Corporations Wake Up Today to a New Debt Era","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
The man who runs Warren Buffett¡¯s railroad worries what the Federal Reserve¡¯s interest-rate hike will mean for his business, even if he thinks it¡¯s the right call. Nissan¡¯s Carlos Ghosn, by contrast, says it¡¯s no big deal.
The reactions of executives like Matt Rose, executive chairman of BNSF Railway Co., and Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Ghosn underscore how life is about to change for companies, for better or worse. Corporations have reveled in seven years of near-zero interest rates to make record-breaking acquisitions, refinance debt and even buy back their own shares with borrowed money. In the U.S. bond market alone, companies raised almost $10 trillion since the Fed first cut its benchmark target to zero in December 2008.
Matt Rose Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg
That era of almost-free money is now starting to end, a transformation that will put pressure on companies to find new ways to grow and juice earnings as rates rise. The potential impacts are wide-ranging. An increase in borrowing costs could spell trouble for the riskiest companies that were propped up by low rates, and strain otherwise creditworthy firms that have loaded up on debt. Stock buybacks will likely decline, possibly crimping share prices. And the dollar could add to its recent gains, stinging exporters. Companies in the housing and auto industries that depend on low-cost financing could also be squeezed.
¡°We may have seen some of the best financing opportunities in a generation for a lot of corporations around the world,¡± said Jonathan Fine, who runs the investment-grade syndicate group for the Americas at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
In reality, the 0.25 percentage-point increase in the central bank¡¯s interest-rate benchmark isn¡¯t going to amount to much for most corporate executives. What will matter is the pace at which the Fed hikes from here. Wednesday¡¯s move brought the benchmark rate to half a percentage point, still a far cry from the four-decade average of about 5 percent.
Gerald O¡¯Driscoll, a former vice president at the Dallas Fed, said he doesn¡¯t expect companies to change their financing habits until rates hit about 1 percent.
If anything, corporate executives say, the rate rise signals a stronger economy and the start of a return to monetary normalcy.
¡°It¡¯s time to raise interest rates,¡± said Gary Kelly, the CEO of Southwest Airlines Co. ¡°You can¡¯t have zero interest rates until infinity.¡±
Money-market interest rates reflected the Fed rate increase . The dollar London interbank offered rate was fixed at 0.3614 percent on Thursday, the highest since 2009.
Gradual Trajectory
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.25 percent, reversing most of a rise after the Fed announcement on Wednesday. Yields declined in Europe on the outlook for a gradual trajectory of further Fed moves. Asian bonds rose for the third straight day.
Companies that rely heavily on exports aren¡¯t so sanguine about the impact on their business as it potentially pushes the dollar higher.
""Our business always quite frankly runs better with a weaker dollar because of our exports,"" said Rose, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc.-owned company delivers goods like cars, food and industrial gear for shipping abroad. It doesn¡¯t help, he said, that Europe is keeping rates low to boost the region¡¯s economy, weighing on the value of the euro.
The dollar rose for a sixth day on Thursday. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against 10 major peers, climbed 0.4 percent as of 7:44 a.m. in New York.Â 
Nissan¡¯s Ghosn said car sales won¡¯t suffer because the hike has been well-telegraphed and will be gradual.
¡°If the second one comes, it means the global economy is in much better shape than what it is today,"" he said.
Unprecedented Stimulus
Corporate America had already taken steps in anticipation of the Fed¡¯s action. When the central bank first signaled plans in 2013 to end its unprecedented stimulus program, the highest-rated companies issued record amounts of debt for back-to-back years to fund M&A, funnel money to shareholders and refinance debt. The goal was to lock in cheap borrowing costs before interest rates rose.
In many ways, the Fed is catching up with a turning cycle that has already seen investors pull back from lending to the riskiest companies. After oil drillers and miners loaded up on cheap debt when commodities were booming, plunging prices are making it difficult for them to refinance their borrowings. More recently, the investor aversion has spread to others that borrowed heavily, including retailers and drug makers.
Issuance by junk-rated companies has slowed this year after they raised an unprecedented $2 trillion of speculative-grade debt. Investors are demanding the most interest since 2009 for the riskiest borrowers, when the global economy was still recovering from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Stable Market
Still, some executives at risky companies welcome the Fed hike as a way to bring stability to capital markets. Jamie Pierson, chief financial officer of YRC Worldwide Inc., a U.S. trucker that restructured its debt at the beginning of 2014 to stave off bankruptcy, said it¡¯s much more difficult for high-yield companies to raise money than six months ago. That should change now that companies and investors have more certainty, he said.
¡°The market hates volatility,¡± Pierson said. ¡°I just want to know what the rates are going to be and let¡¯s get on down the road.¡±
For companies with good credit, the risk of default is negligible. Yet their big debt loads mean that as of the second quarter they owed more in interest than they ever have, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That has made it more expensive for them to borrow, a trend that could worsen with the Fed increase.
Average corporate borrowing costs rose to the highest in nearly four years earlier this week to 4.6 percent from a post-crisis low of 3.3 percent in 2013.
Mortgage Rates
The eventual end of inexpensive financing could hurt sales of such items as cars and homes, which have soared in recent years. But home-improvement retailer Lowe¡¯s Cos. is betting the impact of somewhat less propitious financing conditions will be muted.
CEO Robert Niblock said mortgage rates would have to advance above 6 percent before home affordability weighs on the market -- a level not reached since 2008.
""A slight move by the Fed isn¡¯t going to dramatically change people¡¯s desire and willingness to invest in the home or buy a home,"" Niblock said.

17,$100 Billion ATP Fund Refines Risk With New Investment Model,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
One of Europe¡¯s biggest pension funds says standard diversification models are no longer the best way to invest as it plans a major revamp of its portfolio strategy to redefine risk.
ATP, which oversees about $100 billion in assets, wants to do away with the five risk classes it has used in its investment portfolio since 2006 and replace them with a factor-based strategy. The plan, which still needs to be approved by ATP¡¯s board, is due to be presented in all its detail early next year, according to Carsten Stendevad, the fund¡¯s chief executive officer.
¡°We¡¯re obviously doing this because we think over the long term we¡¯ll get better risk-adjusted returns. Otherwise, we wouldn¡¯t do it,¡± Stendevad said in an interview in Copenhagen on Monday. The new approach is about ¡°squeezing more returns out of a given risk.¡±
The plan involves replacing the risk classes into which ATP currently splits its investment portfolio -- credit, commodities, inflation, interest rates and equities -- with four so-called factors. These will be divided into inflation, interest rates, equities and a final bucket simply labeled ¡°others.¡± The idea is that an asset such as a piece of real estate can be broken down and spread across factors.
¡°This is a clear refinement in how we think about risk,¡± Stendevad said. ¡°We don¡¯t care about asset classifications. We care about the underlying risk dynamics. This gives us great investment flexibility. Somebody can come to us and say we have this particular asset. We won¡¯t say we don¡¯t have an appetite for that particular asset. We¡¯ll say, let¡¯s tear it apart.¡±
The reboot is the latest in a series of measures Stendevad has taken since becoming CEO in 2013, including revamping ATP¡¯s discount curve and reducing its interest rate sensitivity. The proposed switch to factor-based investing will mark a major shift for ATP, requiring a considerable adjustment of the fund¡¯s entire investment infrastructure.
¡°Every system we have has to be rebuilt for this, all of our risk systems,¡± Stendevad said. ¡°This has been a very significant effort internally because this now impacts our risk assessment. Every single asset we have on our books is impacted by this, every single decision is a risk-adjusted decision and will flow through this.¡±
There¡¯s plenty of evidence that some of the world¡¯s biggest investors are struggling to generate returns in the current environment. Norway¡¯s $860 billion sovereign wealth fund revealed a $32 billion loss last quarter, its biggest in four years. Japan¡¯s Government Pension Investment Fund said on Monday a global stock rout in August and September wiped $64 billion off its investments last quarter.
ATP posted a 0.2 percent loss on its investment portfolio in the period after a global market selloff ate into its holdings of stocks, corporate bonds and commodities. It made money on private equity, infrastructure, real estate and long-term inflation hedges.
Given the history, professional investors need to ask themselves whether existing models are still appropriate in the current market climate, according to Stendevad. Even so-called alternative investments may offer a limited hedge if risks aren¡¯t properly assessed, he said.
¡°Are we really getting diversification? Do we really understand the underlying risk in what we¡¯re starting to buy? There¡¯s danger in thinking that just because you buy something that has a different label, that means you get a different risk.¡±
Ultimately, Stendevad says all overhauls target the goal of giving ATP the ¡°operating freedom to be long-term investors.¡±

18,$100 Billion Evaporates as World's Worst Oil Major Plunges 90%,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
Colombia is nursing paper losses of more than $100 billion after its oil boom fell short of expectations, wiping out 90 percent of the value of what was once Latin America¡¯s biggest company.
From being the world¡¯s fifth-most valuable oil producerÂ at its zenith in 2012, worth more than BP Plc, state-controlled Ecopetrol SA now ranks 38th. Its market capitalization has fallen to $14.5 billion, down from its peak of $136.7 billion.
¡°They just haven¡¯t found oil, it¡¯s as simple as that,¡± Rupert Stebbings, the managing director of equity sales at Bancolombia SA, said from Medellin. ¡°The whole oil sector got massively over-bought, and people assumed that one day they¡¯d hit an absolute gusher.¡±
As the army wrested back territory from Marxist guerrillas over the last decade and a half, opening up more land for exploration, the outlook was bright for the oil sector in Colombia, which borders Venezuela, the nation with the world¡¯s largest reserves. Ecopetrol¡¯s share price soared to ¡°irrational levels¡± as investors bet on surging output that then failed to materialize, Stebbings said.Â 
With shares in the oil producer still high, the government opted in 2013 to sell a stake in electricity producer Isagen SA rather than Ecopetrol.
Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas, who sits on the board of Ecopetrol, said in an August 2013 interview that the government didn¡¯t want to sell a further stake in the company because its growth prospects were better than Isagen¡¯s. Since then, Isagen shares have risen 4.2 percent, while Ecopetrol¡¯s have fallen 74 percent. The Isagen stake sale has yet to take place due to a series of legal challenges.
Over the past year, Ecopetrol shares are down 55 percent in dollar terms, the worst performance among global oil drillers with a market capitalization over $10 billion. The company¡¯s original 2015 production target of 1 million barrels of oil equivalent was changed to 760,000 barrels.
Ecopetrol¡¯s growth in oil production since 2006 is among the world¡¯s best, with a 24 percent success rate in exploration in 2014, the company said in an e-mailed response to questions. The Kronos-1 and Orca-1 discoveries in the Colombian Caribbean ¡°opened a new exploration frontier,¡± it said.
Despite some bright spots, including the gas discoveries, exploration budget cuts along with already-meager reserves are worrying, said Corredores Davivienda equity analyst Francisco Chaves.
Slumping oil prices may force the company to downsize its reserves next year, according to Chaves. A foray into Angola last year proved to be an expensive failure, while government hopes that shale exploration could help boost reserves no longer look viable at current oil prices.
¡°The U.S. may have the ability to adapt to low prices and continue with its shale oil and gas industry,¡± Ecopetrol Exploration Vice President Max Torres said in an interview Dec. 3. ¡°But for a new industry like ours it¡¯s very difficult. It¡¯s for the future, when prices improve.¡±

Technology bulls in the stock market are about to get paid.
Pushed up by earnings reports, shares of Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are poised to add $100 billion in market value at the open, based on prices in after-hours trading. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 Index have climbed 2.8 percent since 4 p.m. Thursday in New York, while contracts on the Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index are up 1.2 percent.
Internet and software stocks have been the biggest contributors to the recovery from August¡¯s selloff and are poised Friday to fuel a rally that will erase losses for 2015 in the S&P 500 at the open of trading. Since the bottom on Aug. 25 and before Thursday¡¯s reports, Alphabet had risen 11 percent, Microsoft 19 percent and Amazon.com almost 21 percent. Gains in Facebook Inc. are poised to push the stock over $100 for the first time.
¡°It¡¯s great news to have these gorillas beat estimates, anytime you have Google, Microsoft and Amazon up it will balance out some of the weaker and more lackluster numbers recently,¡± Vincent Delisle, portfolio strategist at Scotia Capital Inc., said in an interview. ¡°The market wants to feel good and it¡¯s a cherry on top with these trademark companies beating estimates.¡±
Microsoft jumped 10 percent, Alphabet surged 9.7 percent and Amazon climbed 9.6 percent at 8:25 a.m. in New York after each reported sales and profits that exceeded analyst estimates. Facebook Inc. didn¡¯t have any news and gained 3.3 percent to $102.94 anyway. The Powershares QQQ Trust exchange-traded fund climbed 2.8 percent to $112.74.
Stocks fell so far and so fast in August that at its depth, the S&P 500 was 15 percent away from the average year-end prediction of Wall Street strategists. Now it¡¯s 5 percent -- and the gap is set to narrow further, with four stocks that already account for one-10th of the recovery in the last two months surging.
Even amid the most volatile year for U.S. equities since 2011, professional stock forecasters on Wall Street have held steady in their year-end calls. The median estimate in January was for the S&P 500 to reach 2,225 in a year, a target that barely budged until mid-August, when a six-day selloff that erased $2 trillion in market value sent the forecast to 2,150, where it stands today.
RBC Capital Markets¡¯ Jonathan Golub, whose forecast is 2,100, said in an interview Thursday that his target now has some ¡°upside¡± again. ¡°It¡¯s frankly happening more than I¡¯d expected or hoped for and I may have not been bullish enough about the resiliency of this market,¡± he said.
After jumping as much as 1.8 percent Thursday, the benchmark gauge for American equities now sits at a level last seen on Aug. 19 and is 7 points below its Dec. 31, 2014 closing price, making its performance year-to-date just about flat. Slicing it differently: U.S shares have climbed back into the trading range that broke in August, heralding the selloff.
¡°We had plenty of people question how we were going to maintain our target,¡± said John Stoltzfus, the New York-based chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. ¡°Our confidence related to the target has been somewhat vindicated by the action since the end of September. It¡¯s a matter of looking at the economics, and we have an expansion showing sustainability and transparency at the Fed.¡±

20,$100 Oil Long Gone Puts Norway Closer to Plundering Wealth Fund,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
With oil nowhere near levels that once made everything easy in Norway, the government may soon face the tough choice of tapping its $900 billion sovereign wealth fund or paring back spending from its shrinking petroleum income.
That¡¯s the unwelcome mathematical truth of falling oil production and crude prices and a growing need to fill budget gaps. It comes as the custodians of the fund, set up to safeguard the wealth of future generations, warn that it also faces diminished returns ahead amid record-low interest rates.
Spending could start to outstrip income ¡°in a short time,¡± at which point ¡°there will be some net transfer from the fund to the fiscal budget,¡± central bank Governor Oeystein Olsen, who oversees the fund, said in a May 8 interview.
Norway¡¯s minority government on Tuesday proposed spending a record 180.9 billion kroner ($24.2 billion) of its oil cash this year. Offshore income is used to plug budget shortfalls and the rest is put into the wealth fund to invest overseas. The fund has grown from about $50 billion at the start of the last decade to become the world¡¯s biggest investor of its kind.
With crude output declining and oil prices low, the government now sees petroleum income falling to 251.6 billion kroner this year, almost 30 percent lower than projected in October.
On and off the record, Norwegian officials are adamant there will be no withdrawals from the fund since only returns generated from its investments will be spent. The government predicts the fund will grow to 8.9 trillion kroner by 2020.
Rich Norwegians
The government has no ¡°contingency plans¡± for potentially making the first withdrawals, said Eva-Karin Dahle Rabben, a spokeswoman at the Finance Ministry. Spokespeople at the wealth fund referred questions to the ministry.
While the government is staying well within a spending rule that limits oil revenue spending to 4 percent of the fund, that rule has lost its meaning as the fund has soared in size.

With an economy stoked by oil wealth, Scandinavia¡¯s richest nation has seen unemployment remain at about 4 percent, even as large swathes of Europe were experiencing double-digit joblessness. Norway has some of the developed world¡¯s highest salaries and most generous welfare benefits.
Oil revenue is received in two ways, via income in kroner from taxes on production and dividends from Statoil ASA and in foreign currency from its direct stake in offshore production.
Plunging Flows
As a first sign of the immense budget shifts awaiting the nation, the central bank was last year forced to start buying kroner with its foreign currency as the krone income was insufficient to cover budget needs. Since March it has been buying 700 million kroner a day.
Capital inflows to the fund will plunge by about 73 percent this year, the government forecasts. That would be the lowest inflow since at least 2000.
¡°This is a big concern,¡± said Marianne Marthinsen, a lawmaker for Labor, Norway¡¯s largest party in opposition. Reversing money from the fund could happen as soon as next year, she said. ¡°The first target we should have is to decrease the amount of oil money that¡¯s spent.¡±
Olsen has called to lower use of the fund to 3 percent, and the Liberals and Christian Democrats, government support parties, have also said Norway needs tighter policy.
Finance Minister Siv Jensen in October appointed a committee to study how the rule works. She declined to comment on the possibility of spending outstripping oil revenue until that review is complete.
¡°The fund is growing at a high speed, there are some risk factors to it, fluctuations of currencies is one,¡± she said on Tuesday in an interview. ¡°That¡¯s why we have this committee, to give us some advice on how to manage this.¡±"
21,$100 Oil Seen Years Away by Petronas as Shale Output Resilient,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
The rally in crude prices may not last as U.S. shale output remains robust, according to Malaysia¡¯s state oil company.
¡°It will take many years until we see oil prices anywhere near the $100 mark,¡± Petroliam Nasional Bhd. President and Chief Executive Officer Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin said at a conference in Kuala Lumpur on Monday. ¡°We¡¯ve underestimated the resilience of U.S. shale production. ¡®We¡¯re still grappling our way to climb out of this big drop.¡±
Oil tumbled almost 50 percent in 2014 as expanding U.S. stockpiles and production exacerbated a global supply glut. While prices have rebounded from a six-year low in March, analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Societe Generale SA are predicting the rally won¡¯t last as the surplus persists. OPEC may further boost output amid a battle for market share, according to the International Energy Agency.
¡°The outlook is not very rosy,¡± said Wan Zulkiflee, who became CEO of the company known as Petronas on April 1. ¡°The sector is going through a downturn. It¡¯s among the most dramatic after the slump caused by 2008-2009 recession.¡±
West Texas Intermediate for June delivery, which expires Tuesday, rose $1.19 to $60.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:25 p.m. Singapore time. The more-active July contract added $1.13 to $61.67. Prices, which were last above $100 in July 2014, have increased 14 percent this year.
U.S. Supplies
U.S. crude inventories shrank for a second week to 484.8 million barrels in the period to May 8, a level that¡¯s more than 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average, according to government data. While the world¡¯s largest consumer is pumping oil at a reduced pace as drillers cut the number of active rigs, output remains near a record.
Slowing U.S. production is drawing attention from rising global stockpiles and prices are likely to slip before the end of the quarter, Societe Generale said this month. The recent rally is premature as the market remains ¡°well oversupplied¡± in 2015 despite the perception of improving fundamentals, Goldman said in a May 11 report.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which supplies 40 percent of the world¡¯s crude, is scheduled to meet June 5 in Vienna. Saudi Arabia led a decision in November to maintain collective quotas at 30 million barrels a day, and the group has pumped above that target for the past 11 months, according to a Bloomberg survey of companies and analysts. OPEC¡¯s push to defend its share of the global oil market has just begun, the IEA said in its monthly report May 13."

Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Architect Wang Shu¡¯s answer to the wholesale destruction of historic Chinese cities is to collect the stones of demolished buildings and install them in new ones.
The Hyatt Foundation of Chicago announced today that Wang has won the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize. He will receive $100,000 and a bronze medallion this May in Beijing.
With his wife, architect Lu Wenyu, Wang runs a small firm called Amateur Architecture Studio, staffed mostly by students in Hangzhou, southwest of Shanghai. He also heads the architecture department of the China Academy of Art in Hangzhou.
Wang wasn¡¯t an obvious choice for the prestigious 34-year-old Pritzker because he isn¡¯t the well-established celebrity architect such big awards often celebrate. (Norman Foster, Zaha Hadid and Jean Nouvel have been winners in the past dozen years.)
In choosing Wang, 49, the jury had a point to make.
¡°Over the coming decades, China¡¯s success at urbanization will be important to China and to the world,¡± said Thomas J. Pritzker, chairman of The Hyatt Foundation in a statement. The late billionaire Jay Pritzker founded Hyatt Hotels Corp.
As it hurtles into an urban future of megacities, China has obliterated centuries of urban and cultural history.
The development juggernaut leaves behind super-blocks filled with characterless towers wrapped by vast car-clogged boulevards.
A few years ago one fast-rising Chinese architect told me the country will come to see its industrialized assembly-line city-making as madness.
Amateur Architecture
Wang, in a series of idiosyncratic works, has gently attempted to help Chinese realize what they are erasing.
Wang¡¯s History Museum in Ningbo looks like an ancient fortress, with tilting walls that appear eroded by centuries. Up close the walls look weathered because they are exquisitely composed of worn salvaged stones and old arched roof tiles that alternate the predominant gray with bright orange patches of squiggly terra cotta.
Inside, angled walls and narrow passages that open to grand atrium spaces similarly evoke the mysterious qualities of the narrow streets that twist and turn through traditional Chinese cities.
Local officials originally hated ¡°the dirty old materials,¡± Wang said in a telephone interview. Yet people come to the museum again and again for its evocation of the 30 picturesque area villages that disappeared in the name of progress. The officials ¡°gave me a formal apology,¡± he said.
Big and Fast
Many of the Chinese architects of Wang¡¯s generation have been trained in the best universities of the U.S. and Europe, and have rapidly come to prominence designing massive developments and entire cities at mind-boggling scale and speed.
By contrast, Wang trained entirely in China and set architecture aside for several years while he learned craft skills working with artisans.
Wang has little use for the formal coherence I expect from Western architects. That¡¯s especially visible in designs for the Xiangshan Campus of the China Academy of Art.
One building seems to project arbitrarily into a pond, with a roof that drapes between serried peaks. An external stair runs up and down an outside wall like a graph line.
He arranged windows in elaborate decorative patterns, some evoking traditional screens, others whimsical calligraphic characters.
Some of Wang¡¯s buildings make an awkward first impression; they seem not so much designed as improvised.
¡°It¡¯s 21 buildings, the scale of a small town,¡± said Wang of the Xiangshan Campus. ¡°It¡¯s intended to look like a natural evolution rather than one architect¡¯s vision.¡±
Undisciplined to my eyes, this work must be utterly refreshing in today¡¯s China.
I suspect Wang is too much a hothouse flower to change the direction of his nation¡¯s gigantic urban-development machine. But I commend the Pritzker jury for making him an international messenger for humane, people-centered places.

23,Argentine Bonds Held at Federal Reserve Can Be Seized,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 7 (Bloomberg) -- A judge granted an investor request to seize $105 million in Argentine assets held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan said today that EM Ltd. and NML Capital may ¡°attach¡± funds deposited by the Central Bank of Argentina in the New York Fed. An appeals court previously barred EM and NML from doing so under different legal grounds. Griesa considered a new legal argument by the investors and said the Argentine funds may be seized.
¡°The impact of it is enormous, because it means any central bank assets anywhere can be seized by our clients,¡± said David W. Rivkin, a lawyer for EM, which has a judgment against Argentina for defaulting on bonds.
The freeze was sought by bondholders who won hundreds of millions of dollars in judgments against Argentina stemming from a 2001 default. EM is owed about $800 million, Rivkin said.
The ruling follows other decisions by Griesa and the appeals court over other Argentine assets that investors have sought to obtain. In March, Griesa declined to freeze billions of dollars held at Citigroup Inc.¡¯s Argentina unit.
Griesa said Argentina¡¯s use of funds from its central bank ¡°has contributed to fraud and injustice perpetrated by the republic on the bondholders.¡± He said Argentina used the funds ¡°to pay billions of dollars to get rid of debts which the republic wished to be rid of¡± while refusing to pay bond debt.
Fed Opposed Seizure
The New York Fed filed a brief opposing the seizure, Griesa said. Recognizing that ¡°the Federal Reserve is surely a most important institution,¡± Griesa said the U.S. court system is also important, and Argentina is defying the court¡¯s judgments.
Before the investors may seize the funds, there must be further court proceedings and possibly an appeal by Argentina.
Jonathan Blackman, a lawyer for Argentina, declined to comment.
Rivkin said Griesa accepted the argument that the Argentina Central Bank is the ¡°alter ego¡± of the government. That claim wasn¡¯t advanced in the proceeding decided by the appeals court.
The yield on Argentina¡¯s 7 percent dollar bonds due in 2015 climbed the most since Feb. 23 after the news of the ruling became public.
The case is NML Capital v. Republic of Argentina, 06-cv-6466, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

24,$120 Billion Danish Fund Clings to German Debt in Price Flip,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Denmark¡¯s ATP pension fund, which oversees $120 billion in assets, says it won¡¯t sell any of the German government bonds in its main portfolio as debt markets get jolted by fears of a bubble.
Those assets form a ¡°strategic hedge of ATP¡¯s pension guarantees and we are therefore not interested in selling,¡± Chief Executive Officer Carsten Stendevad said in an e-mailed response to questions.
The comments cover bonds in a portfolio that holds more than 80 percent of ATP¡¯s total assets. In its other portfolio, where the fund takes bigger risks to generate higher returns, ¡°we are positioned to benefit from rising interest rates,¡± Stendevad said. ATP held $30 billion in German government bonds at the end of 2014, making it one of Europe¡¯s biggest owners of the debt, its annual accounts show.
ATP is voicing its commitment to debt sold by Europe¡¯s biggest economy amid a market rout that started at the end of April, when investors began questioning the logic of yields that for some maturities were below zero. Combined with a rebound in oil prices and a return of inflation, the shift in sentiment has triggered a series of market gyrations as buyers and sellers struggle to find a new equilibrium.
The yield on Germany¡¯s 10-year government bond rose three basis points as of 9 a.m. in London to 0.65 percent. It was 0.61 percent a week ago and as low as about 0.07 percent on April 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Futures Trading
Price swings have been exacerbated by a lack of liquidity, after the European Central Bank started its bond-purchase program. Stendevad says much of the movement in prices is being driven by short-term investors trading derivatives.
¡°The liquidity and risk appetite in the bond market have obviously been reduced,¡± Stendevad said. ¡°It seems like a futures-driven selloff more than a cash-driven selloff in German government bonds, so I would think that it is more the tactical investors such as some hedge funds, who experience pressure.¡±
Trading in German bund futures on Deutsche Boerse AG¡¯s Eurex intensified earlier this month, driving volume to its highest level since 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors are using the derivatives to get access to deeper market liquidity as the volume of available bonds declines, in part because of central bank purchases and as stricter liquidity requirements force banks to hold onto their bonds.
European debt markets aren¡¯t the only ones suffering. The global selloff in bonds that started late April is the worst in two years and has wiped more than $400 billion from markets worldwide.
¡°The rates volatility is yet another reminder that traditional risk models may not pick up the true risk inherent in the current financial markets,¡± Stendevad said. ¡°We certainly expect more turbulence over the coming period than we have been used to the past years.¡±"
25,$138 Billion Swedish Fund Slashes Equities to Escape ¡®Herd¡¯,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Swedbank Robur, which oversees $138 billion in assets, has more than halved its equity exposure at some funds to avoid being caught on the wrong side of markets once the ¡°herd¡± realizes stocks are over-valued.
In the multi-asset funds with the broadest equity mandates, Sweden¡¯s biggest fund manager reduced its equity exposure to about 30 percent in April from 80 to 85 percent in the second half of last year, Head of Multi Asset Per Storfaelt said in a June 11 interview in Stockholm. The division manages about 140 billion kronor ($17.3 billion) in assets.
A big part of the risk threatening to drive losses in Europe stems from Greece, according to Robur. The failure to reach any stable solution to Greece¡¯s economic crisis has helped drive a 10 percent slump in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index from an April high. But the risk of a deal not being struck between Greece and its creditors hasn¡¯t triggered downgrades from any of the 15 stock forecasters tracked by Bloomberg for year-end estimates for European indexes.
¡°In April, the majority of the market participants assumed that the drama in Greece was going to be solved in the end,¡± Storfaelt said. ¡°How did we play it? We took down risk more than we would otherwise have done. We still judge it will play out worse than the market expects.¡±
Rising Indexes?
It¡¯s a controversial standpoint, with some of Europe¡¯s biggest banks still predicting a rebound in stocks. UBS Group AG raised its projection for European indexes this month, citing better-than-expected earnings growth and a turnaround in the economy. Citigroup Inc., the most bullish firm, sees the Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumping 17 percent through the end of the year. But Storfaelt says going with the flow is starting to look risky.
¡°There are clear advantages to going against the herd at the moment,¡± he said.¡°You get more return taking less risk by not joining a herd that goes for an asset without fundamental backing.¡± Ultimately, investors are aware of the disconnect between fundamentals and valuations, so they¡¯re ¡°trigger-happy.¡± That means they¡¯re ready to ¡°reverse as soon as things shake a little,¡± he said.
Storfaelt says central bank stimulus in Europe has propped up markets and encouraged investors to expect a helping hand even though stocks are over-valued. But the question is whether the disbelief that ought to be kicking in can continue to be suspended. He says the shortage of liquidity is a sign people are starting to doubt the sustainability of the current price environment.
¡¯Clear Stance¡¯
Robur has made money on its contrarian stance in the past. In mid-2011, the fund bought up European equities, even though ¡°everyone believed Europe was finished,¡± Storfaelt said. We ¡°took a clear stance and aggressively increased the equity weight.¡± The deal ultimately paid off. Since the end of June 2011, the Stoxx Europe 600 index has gained more than 40 percent. ¡°It is kind of the same situation now, but the reverse,¡± he said.
Negotiations between Greece and its creditors are close to collapsing as finance ministers meet in Luxembourg on Thursday. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said June 17 he¡¯s ready to take responsibility for rejecting the terms of an aid deal if his government finds the terms unacceptable. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday that a deal with Greece is still possible, provided that the Greek government follows through on the economic-reform pledges made to creditors.
Storfaelt said Swedbank Robur sees a higher probability of a Greek default than the rest of the market. The risk ¡°that it ends badly is higher than 50 percent,¡± he said. Pressure on Greece grew on Thursday as International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said the country won¡¯t be given a grace period if it fails to make a payment at the end of the month.
¡°Market participants often make the mistake of assuming that everybody else -- for instance when it comes to Greece -- is driven by economic considerations,¡± Storfaelt said.¡°In Greece, the end-game will be much more driven by ideological beliefs and the question is where this will lead.¡±"
26,$154 Billion in Share Sales Stuck After Chinese Market Meltdown,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
More than $154 billion of share offerings in China are in danger of being shelved as the collateral damage from the nation¡¯s stock-market rout spreads.
¡°Selling new shares now, whether publicly or privately, is like trying to draw blood from a patient who¡¯s already looking so weak and pale,¡± said Zhang Qi, an analyst at Haitong Securities Co. in Shanghai.
With China unleashing measure after measure to contain the meltdown, Warren Buffett-backed automaker BYD Co. and China Railway Group Ltd. are among the hundreds of companies staring at follow-on offerings that may now be in jeopardy, many of which are trading below the price they planned to sell the shares at, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Chinese stocks have lost about $3.9 trillion in market value in less than a month despite the various government measures including the suspension of IPOs and restrictions on bearish bets via stock-index futures.
¡°Any kind of fundraising will be difficult to place in this market,¡± said Hong Hao, Bocom International Holdings Co.¡¯s Hong Kong-based chief strategist. ¡°Even if you managed to place a secondary offering, you would have to price it at a substantial discount and the low price will in turn induce more anxiety.¡±
China Grand Automotive Services Co. was among the fortunate few managing to complete a share placement before such deals ground to a halt. After selling $3.7 billion of stock at 20.18 yuan apiece last month, the shares closed at 14.98 yuan in Shanghai on July 7 before they were suspended from trading.
Below Offer
Others haven¡¯t been as lucky as the rout drove shares below their intended placement price. In Shenzhen, Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. closed at 13.66 yuan at the 11:30 a.m. trading break on Thursday, 19 percent below the brokerage¡¯s 16.92 yuan offer price. Electric-car maker BYD is now trading at 48.43 yuan, versus an offer price of 57.40 yuan. Still, China Railway is trading at 12.70 yuan, 68 percent above its placement price.
BYD spokeswoman Sherry Li said the market has been acting ¡°irrational¡± recently and that the company is proceeding with its plans. The company also has a year to proceed with the placement.
China Railway didn¡¯t immediately respond to a faxed request for comment, while Shenwan Hongyuan declined to comment.
¡°If I were them, I would cancel the offering if there is no urgent need for the cash,¡± Bocom¡¯s Hong said, in reference to companies seeking to sell shares. ¡°It¡¯s about liquidity. People will only take money from you and not give you any in this market.¡±"
27,$19-an-Hour Waiters Are One of the Hurdles to Growth in Australia,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
Award-winning chef Ben Willis would have no trouble filling his Canberra restaurant on Sundays. It¡¯s been voted the best in the Australian capital three years running.
But faced with a A$25.94 ($19.12)-an-hour wage bill even for trainee waiters under Australia¡¯s complex system of pay rates, he says it makes no financial sense to open.
¡°These restrictions to business are so out of date,¡± said Willis, 40, of the so-called penalty rates that double wages for Sunday shifts in some service industries. ¡°It¡¯s a changing market place and a changing society.¡±
The issue is coming to the fore in an economy experiencing its weakest run of growth since the 1991 recession and with unemployment matching an almost 13-year high. Yet two years after being elected on a pro-business agenda, Prime Minister Tony Abbott¡¯s government is showing little appetite to overhaul the labor market after the last attempt to do so brought down his conservative predecessor, John Howard.
¡°The labor market is now rigid, hampering small businesses and potentially capping growth,¡± said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. ¡°It¡¯s been 96 quarters since the last recession, which has made Australians wary of the reform it needs.¡±
Workplace reform is fraught with political risks for Abbott¡¯s Liberal-National coalition, which is languishing behind the main opposition Labor party in opinion polls before elections due next year.

Abbott¡¯s mentor, Howard, was the last leader to grasp the nettle, stripping back workers¡¯ rights including protection against unfair dismissal with his ¡°WorkChoices¡± legislation. A voter backlash against the law helped bring down Howard¡¯s coalition government in 2007.
WorkChoices was replaced in 2009 by Labor¡¯s Fair Work Act, under which a system of 122 workplace agreements, or awards, stipulate wage rates, entitlements and overtime. Shop workers can earn as much as A$46.46 an hour on Sundays under one award.
¡°Penalty rates in Australia do fly in the face of market forces,¡± said Saul Eslake, former chief Australia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ¡°Australia has more onerous penalty-rate arrangements on employers than many other countries.¡±
In a draft report earlier this month, the government¡¯s Productivity Commission recommended that Sunday rates in hospitality, retail, restaurants and cafes be pared back in line with Saturday levels. That would see the pay for some employees drop from 200 percent of their weekday hourly rate to 125 percent.
Creating Jobs
The change, the commission said, would likely increase business opening hours and create job opportunities. In some U.S. states, wait staff can earn as little as $2.13 an hour before tips, which often make up the bulk of their salary. In Washington D.C., the minimum combined cash and tip wage rate is $10.50 an hour.
The commission dismissed any need for widespread change in industrial relations, saying Australia¡¯s labor market performed relatively well by global standards.
The commission has put a real overhaul of the ¡°overly complex, conflict-driven¡± awards system ¡°into the too-hard basket,¡± Jennifer Westacott, chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, which represents the nation¡¯s largest companies, said in an Aug. 13 speech.
Spending Cuts
Abbott¡¯s government, weakened by a voter backlash against sweeping spending cuts in its first budget in May 2014, has since shunned major reforms in areas such as taxation and pension savings. He¡¯s ruled out changes to workplace relations in this term, beyond pledges he made before coming to office such as checking the power of trade unions.
Legislation to help stamp out union corruption and restrict strikes in the construction industry was defeated in the upper house on Monday.
The government is likely to shy away from any wider labor market overhaul even if it is re-elected, according to political analyst Andrew Hughes. A Fairfax Ipsos poll published Monday showed support for Abbott¡¯s coalition has fallen 1 percentage point to 46 percent, while Labor rose 1 point to 54 percent on a two-party preferred basis.
¡°Abbott knows that any real toughening up of industrial relations laws that are seen to be stripping workers of their rights will be political poison,¡± said Hughes, of the Australian National University in Canberra.
Wage Growth
Cutting penalty rates would be counterproductive for an economy experiencing weak wage growth, according to Stephen Koukoulas, a former adviser to Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Hourly rates of pay for private sector workers rose 2.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the weakest growth in records dating back to 1997.
¡°We need to find ways to help the economy to expand instead of delivering another a knock on real wages growth through something like a cut in penalty rates,¡± said Koukoulas, managing director of Canberra-based Market Economics Pty.
For Willis, whose Aubergine restaurant and other Canberra eatery Temporada are closed on Sundays, change is essential.
¡°Tourists come here and they complain that nothing is open on a Sunday,¡± he said. ¡°It¡¯s a bad look.¡±"
28,Reduced LBO Fees Mean 2% Disappears as Pensions Lament Losses,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
July 6 (Bloomberg) -- The 2 percent management fee that has been the industry benchmark for leveraged buyout funds since the 1970s is headed for extinction.
The California Public Employees¡¯ Retirement System, the biggest U.S. public pension plan, AlpInvest Partners NV, Europe¡¯s largest backer of private equity funds, and HarbourVest Partners LLC, which has more than $10 billion in LBO funds, are pressing firms to cut their rates.
¡°We should be able to get a better deal from private-equity firms in this market,¡± said George R. Anson, managing director at Boston-based HarbourVest.
Buyout firms recorded a 31 percent decline in the value of their holdings last year, the biggest drop since London-based research firm Preqin Ltd. started collecting the data in the 1980s. The market slump has led to a 75 percent reduction in LBOs in 2009 and prompted investors to challenge a pay structure that rewards managers without requiring them to turn a profit.
¡°We would like lower fees, especially those not related to performance,¡± AlpInvest Chief Economist Peter Cornelius said in an interview at an industry conference last week in Geneva.
Investors would have been better-off last year owning shares of Pacific Investment Management Co.¡¯s $156.9 billion Total Return Fund. The world¡¯s biggest bond mutual fund gained 4.8 percent and levied a management charge of just 0.25 percent.
Time for ¡®Diet¡¯
LBOs plummeted to $37 billion in the first half of this year from a record $482 billion in the same period of 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Stock market declines are forcing firms to write down the value of their investments, leaving investors with their first paper losses in at least five years.
Even before the LBO boom ended, firms earned almost twice as much from what they charged clients than from the gains they received from selling companies, according to a 2007 study by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
LBO funds collect $10.35 of management compensation for every $100 they oversee, compared with the $5.41 they get from selling companies at a profit, according to the Wharton report.
¡°The whole budget of private-equity firms is going to change with no transaction fees, smaller management fees and smaller funds raised,¡± said Mounir Guen, chief executive officer of London-based MVision Private Equity Advisers Ltd., which helps buyout firms raise funds. ¡°It will be like being on a diet and going to the gym regularly all of a sudden.¡±
First KKR Fund
When Henry Kravis, his cousin George R. Roberts and former partner Jerome Kohlberg raised their first LBO fund in 1978, they charged a $500,000 management fee equal to 2.5 percent of the assets they were seeking, according to marketing documents for the KKR Investment Fund.
The industry average stayed at about 2 percent until 2008, according to Preqin. Companies starting new funds this year are seeking an average management stipend of 1.8 percent. The figure is closer to 1.65 percent for offerings with more than $1 billion, Preqin reported.
LBO managers use the proceeds to cover their operating costs and typically take 20 percent of any investment profits they earn. The size of the average buyout pool increased 87 percent in the past five years to $1.5 billion, Preqin said.
¡°For years, investors completely disregarded lower management fees,¡± said Jon Moulton, founder of London-based private equity firm Alchemy Partners LLP, in a telephone interview. ¡°It¡¯s changing now.¡±
Four of every five investors in Europe and North America plan to request better terms over the next two years, according to a survey conducted in April by London-based Coller Capital Ltd., which buys stakes in LBO funds after they¡¯re up and running.
Blackstone Offering
Investors are in a better position to dictate terms as capital for buyout funds becomes scarcer, said David Rubenstein, co-founder of Carlyle Group, the world¡¯s second-biggest LBO firm by assets, during an interview last week in Geneva.
¡°It¡¯s taking longer to raise any funds,¡± said Rubenstein, 59, whose Washington-based firm spent about 14 months to gather $1.04 billion for a pool to invest in Asia. ¡°Some firms may have fees coming down.¡±
Blackstone Group LP, the largest LBO firm, plans to charge a management rate of 1.5 percent for a $15 billion fund that it¡¯s halfway through putting together, said two people with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified before the fund closes. That would be equal to the fee on its previous pool, a $21.7 billion fund closed in 2007. Blackstone spokesman Peter Rose declined to comment.
HgCapital Cuts Fee
As HgCapital LLP started seeking 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) last year, it planned a 2 percent rate, said three people familiar with the decision, who declined to be named. HgCapital ended up reducing the figure to 1.75 percent as it struggled to reach the fundraising target and investors complained, the people said.
George Hudson, an outside spokesman for the London-based firm, declined to comment.
¡°It¡¯s too early to say if it¡¯s going to be a significant market phenomenon,¡± AlpInvest¡¯s Cornelius said.
Amsterdam-based AlpInvest has about 40 billion euros ($56 billion) with firms, including Carlyle, New York-based Blackstone, as well as CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and Permira Advisers LLP, which are both based in London.
Investors cut commitments to new funds this year by 57 percent to $51 billion after the value of their stock and bond holdings tumbled amid the global freeze in the credit markets, Preqin said. Private equity executives are taking 18 months on average to compile new funds, compared with less than 12 months as recently as two years ago.
Relative Performance
¡°When returns are bad, people just stop giving funds money,¡± said Steven Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ¡°They¡¯ll pay fees in the long run, but only to the good funds.¡±
The industry points to long-term performance to justify the compensation. In the five years ended Dec. 31, LBO funds generated annual returns of 25 percent, according to Preqin data. The Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index fell 2.2 percent a year on average during the same period, including reinvested dividends, and the MSCI World Index was unchanged.
¡°There¡¯s going to be much greater focus on justification of management fee levels,¡± said Joseph Dear, chief investment officer at Sacramento-based Calpers, in an interview last week at the Geneva conference.
Calpers has about 11.5 percent of its $184.6 billion under management in private equity funds. Returns from those investments with outside firms, including Blackstone and Carlyle, dropped to 5.8 percent in the 12 months ended June 2008 from 23.2 percent in the previous year.
Pension Payouts
The decline weighed on Calpers¡¯s investment performance as the fund¡¯s assets have dropped about 29 percent from a peak of $260 billion in 2007.
Calpers paid $376.3 million to private equity managers in 2007, up 50 percent from $249.9 million in the prior year, the pension plan said in its June 2008 annual report.
The pace of LBOs has slowed by about 75 percent this year, as the debt financing on which they rely for takeovers dried up with the credit crisis, according to Bloomberg data.
¡°Most of the large buyout funds haven¡¯t been able to do deals because there¡¯s no debt,¡± said Mark Cunningham, managing director at London-based Jefferies Helix Ltd., which helps raise funds for LBO firms. ¡°Some of their limited partners have suggested that if the situation persists, they will want to revise down management fees.¡±
Calpers¡¯s Dear said he expects firms to drop so-called transaction charges -- fees charged by the firms for buying and selling assets -- and raise smaller funds.
The California pension plan wants terms from buyout executives that ¡°reflect a better alignment of their interests¡± with those of their investors, Dear said at last week¡¯s industry conference in Geneva.

China passed the U.S. to become the world's biggest Internet market with 253 million Web users at the end of June, the state-backed China Network Information Center said today.
The Asian nation added 43 million Web users in the first six months of this year, while the number of Internet users in the U.S. increased to 230 million at the end of June from 218 million last year, the Beijing-based agency, which licenses online domain names, said in a statement on its Web site.
Rising incomes in an economy that's grown by more than 10 percent for 10 consecutive quarters has fueled demand for access to the Internet. China may have 406 million Web users by 2010, greater than the populations of the U.S. and the U.K. combined, according to estimates by Credit Suisse Group AG."
30,"¡®2 Guns¡¯ Buddy-Cop Film Tops Weekend, ¡®Smurfs 2¡¯ Is Third","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 5 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°2 Guns,¡± a buddy cop comedy-thriller featuring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, was the top weekend film in U.S. and Canadian theaters, collecting $27.1 million for Universal Pictures.
¡°The Smurfs 2,¡± a family feature combining animation with live action, opened with $17.5 million in receipts for Sony Corp. to place third, researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office said in a statement yesterday. The receipts, which missed the estimate of Boxoffice.com, were about half of the opening sales for the original movie in 2011. The returning film ¡°The Wolverine¡± was second with $21.3 million.
¡°2 Guns,¡± a tale of undercover lawmen trying to catch a drug kingpin, taps the bickering buddy movie formula successfully mined by Hollywood in films such as ¡°Lethal Weapon¡± and marks the seventh No. 1 weekend opening this year for Universal, part of Comcast Corp. The movie, made for $61 million, was projected to have sales of $34 million, according to Boxoffice.com.
¡°The chemistry is obvious in the film,¡± Nikki Rocco, president of distribution for Universal Pictures, said in an interview. ¡°Hopefully, it finds its own life in a marketplace that¡¯s very crowded.¡±
Washington plays Drug Enforcement Administration agent Bobby Trench, while Wahlberg is cast as U.S. naval intelligence officer Marcus Stigman. The two reluctantly work undercover as members of a narcotics syndicate. When their attempt to infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel goes haywire, they are disavowed by their superiors and can only count on each other.
¡°This is a business where being No. 1 is always wonderful,¡± Rocco said. ¡°It¡¯s nice to be on a roll.¡±
So-so Review
The film garnered a 59 percent favorable rating out of 97 reviews aggregated by Rottentomatoes.com.
¡°More is much less in ¡®2 Guns,¡¯¡± wrote Bloomberg News critic Greg Evans. ¡°An extended and clever preamble raises our hopes,¡± before the picture ¡°devolves into an ultra-violent mad, mad, mad world,¡± wrote Evans, who gave the film two stars, or a ¡°so-so¡± rating.
¡°The Smurfs 2,¡± which opened July 31, is the follow-up to Sony¡¯s 2011 global hit, which generated 75 percent of its $563.7 million in worldwide sales outside the U.S., according to Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher. The picture combines cartoon characters with live action and features Hank Azaria, Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays.
¡®Smurfs 2¡¯
Produced at a cost of $105 million, ¡°The Smurfs 2¡± will need to replicate the success overseas to be profitable for Sony, SNL Kagan said. Boxoffice.com had forecast weekend sales of $23 million for ¡°The Smurfs 2.¡± The first film generated $35.6 million in domestic theaters in its opening weekend.
¡°U.S. interest in the 3-D franchise seems to have waned among adult moviegoers,¡± SNL Kagan said in a note last week. ¡°International grosses will have to remain very strong for the film to have a chance of making money.¡±
Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Sony Pictures, said the first film, ¡°The Smurfs,¡± exceeded ¡°our most wild¡± expectations and set a high bar for the sequel.
¡°We did open a little bit less than what we hoped for, but I think we more than made up for it¡± internationally, he said in an interview. The movie took in $52.5 million outside the U.S., which was about 4 percent less than the 2011 opening of the original movie, according to Sony.
¡®Blue Jasmine¡¯
The sequel takes the diminutive blue cartoon characters known as Smurfs to Paris and also features voices of Katy Perry and Jimmy Kimmel. It had a 13 percent positive rating out of 72 reviews on Rottentomatoes. The studio is on track for a third Smurfs film in 2015, Bruer said.
Among returning films, the Marvel superhero picture ¡°The Wolverine¡± from 21st Century Fox Inc. fell to second after finishing atop the rankings a week ago. It has had sales of $94.6 million in its two weeks of release.
¡°The Conjuring,¡± the low-budget horror from Time Warner Inc.¡¯s Warner Bros., dropped to fourth place with $13 million.
Woody Allen¡¯s ¡°Blue Jasmine¡± took in $1.86 million, after opening to packed audiences in six theaters last weekend. This past weekend it played in 50 cities, including Washington and San Francisco, the setting for much of the film.
Starring Cate Blanchett as the wife of a Bernie Madoff-like swindler, the movie may rival ¡°Midnight in Paris¡± as Allen¡¯s top-grossing film, according to Michael Barker, co-president and co-founder of Sony Pictures Classics, which distributed both movies.
Weekend revenue for the top 12 films rose 8.3 percent to $123.3 million from the year-earlier period, Hollywood.com said. Attendance year to date is down 3.4 percent, while revenue has declined less than 1 percent.

32,"$20 Million Sale at Saatchi Gallery Rides China, Russia Booms","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 21 (Bloomberg) -- Collectors are to be lured by as much as 13 million pounds ($20 million) of art from some of the world¡¯s fastest-growing economies at an auction planned for the Saatchi Gallery in London this week.
The 438-lot sale on April 23 and 24 is the first dedicated to contemporary art, design and photography from the ¡°BRIC¡± countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, its organizer Phillips de Pury & Co. said in an e-mailed statement.
¡°The most recent sales have shown that demand for Indian and Chinese art is improving,¡± Finn Dombernowsky, a London-based director at Phillips, said in an interview. ¡°Brazil is a completely new market.¡±
The sale comes at a time when auction prices for works by some contemporary Chinese, Indian and Russian artists are still as much as 50 percent lower than at the height of the market in early 2008, said dealers. Prices of high-value Chinese contemporary works fell 70 percent during the financial rout from a peak in May 2008. Still, the artist record HK$19.1 million ($2.5 million) paid for Liu Ye¡¯s 1995 painting ¡°Bright Road¡± at Sotheby¡¯s, Hong Kong, on April 5 was the highest auction price for a Chinese contemporary work for two years.
¡°We expect, of course, interest to come from the BRIC countries themselves,¡± Simon de Pury, chairman of Phillips, said in an interview. ¡°There are very active collectors in those four countries. But the most important collectors these days, they just want to buy the best from wherever it may come in the world.¡±
The sale is the sixth in a series of themed auctions to be held by the New York-based company, which said it expects the event to make at least 9 million pounds.
¡°The timing of this sale is better than two years ago,¡± said Dombernowsky. ¡°For buyers it makes more sense.¡±
Charles Saatchi
Collector Charles Saatchi will give over his entire gallery in Chelsea, west London, to the view and sale, said Phillips. Entrance to the gallery has been free since it opened in October 2008 (with an exhibition of contemporary Chinese art), thanks to an agreement between Saatchi and the auction house. Phillips¡¯s London headquarters is located nearby in Victoria.
The most highly valued work in the sale is the 1995 word painting, ¡°ENTRANCE -- NO ENTRANCE,¡± by the Russian artist Erik Bulatov, estimated at 350,000 pounds to 450,000 pounds.
The Bulatov -- a second version of a work painted in 1974 and 1975 -- is being offered in a 32-lot evening sale on April 23 by a European collector who acquired it from the artist, according to the 544-page magazine-style catalog. The estimate is less than half the 916,000 pounds a comparable 1985 painting by Bulatov fetched at Phillips in February 2008.
Indian Art
Subodh Gupta¡¯s trademark 2006 painting of metal pots and pans, ¡°Idol Thief 1,¡± leads the Indian works with an estimate of 320,000 pounds to 380,000 pounds. Two similar paintings by Gupta sold at auction for $1.4 million and $1.2 million respectively in 2008, according to the database Artnet.
¡°The market for contemporary Indian art hasn¡¯t bounced back yet,¡± said Conor Macklin, director of the London-based Grosvenor Gallery, which specializes in Indian modern and contemporary works. Comparable Gupta paintings of kitchenware were currently selling for as little as $150,000 in India, Macklin said.
¡°Overall Phillips¡¯s auction is well-priced,¡± said Macklin in an interview. ¡°There¡¯s something for everyone. The question is, are there enough buyers?¡±
Watch Dogs
Frank Cohen, a collector from Wolverhampton in the U.K.¡¯s Midlands, is among the sellers, said dealers. Cohen is offering two works dating from 2008 by the Indian artist T.V. Santhosh. The oil-on-canvas diptych ¡°Enemies¡¯ Enemy II,¡± and the apocalyptic multimedia installation ¡°Counting Down,¡± featuring a pack of 30 fiberglass dogs with digital clocks, carry low estimates of 100,000 pounds and 50,000 pounds respectively.
Zhang Xiaogang leads the Chinese contingent with a 2006 painting, ¡°Amnesia and Memory,¡± valued at 220,000 pounds to 320,000 pounds. Zhang¡¯s ¡°Bloodline: The Big Family No. 3¡± fetched a record HK$47.4 million ($6.1 million) at Sotheby¡¯s Hong Kong in April 2008.
Just three works by Brazilian artists are included in the evening auction. Lygia Clark, one of the founders of the Neo-Concretist group, is represented by the folding aluminum geometric sculpture ¡°Bicho.¡± The work dates from about 1960 and is expected to fetch as much as 220,000 pounds, a new price level for the artist at auction.
In recent years Brazilian contemporary artists have not attracted the same levels of speculative investment as their Chinese, Indian and Russian counterparts.
The auction record for Clark is 59,000 euros ($79,600) paid for another 1960s aluminum sculpture at a sale in Germany in June 2006. The price is only one of 20 auction results for the Brazilian artist reported on Artnet.

33,$20 Oil? Three Things We Learned This Week,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp 1) Oil
As crude tumbles in its worst summer ever, experts are lining up to forecastÂ exactly how low it will go.
Among the lowest so far is $10 to $20 a barrel, which came from Gary Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling Co., who spoke in a BloombergÂ Television interview on Friday. Because fixed costs are already spent, drillers in a ¡°price war¡± will keep pumping as long as prices are above the cash costs of production, which are below today¡¯s levels of around $49 a barrel in London.
Â 
Â 2) YuanÂ 
The week brought a shock from the People¡¯s Bank of China, which devalued its currency as exports sputter. The move rattled financial markets from Tokyo to Chicago, and the currency continued its slide.Â 
The policy suggests China is stepping up efforts to combat the deepest economic slowdown since 1990 and reduce the government¡¯s grip on the financial system. Authorities had been propping up the yuan to deter capital outflows, protect foreign-currency borrowers and make a case for official reserve status at the International Monetary Fund.
Â 
3) Google
ItÂ was a good week at Google, which is reorganizing into a holding company calledÂ Alphabet Inc., breaking out its main Web operations from ambitious new endeavors such as research lab Google X and Calico, which seeks to extend human lives.Â 
The structure, announced Monday, will give greater clarity into how Google invests in various ventures, including driverless cars, high-speed Internet service and health-related technologies. It also makes it easier to make any future acquisitions or potential divestments.

34,¡®21 Jump Street¡¯ Is Top Film With Sales of $36.3 Million,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 19 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°21 Jump Street,¡± a film spoof of the 1980s TV series that starred Johnny Depp, led the U.S. and Canadian box office this past weekend, generating $36.3 million in ticket sales for Sony Corp.¡¯s Columbia Pictures.
¡°Dr. Seuss¡¯ The Lorax,¡± the No. 1 film for the previous two weekends, fell to second place with $22.8 million in receipts for Comcast Corp.¡¯s Universal Pictures, Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed statement. Will Ferrell¡¯s ¡°Casa de mi Padre¡± and Jason Segel¡¯s ¡°Jeff, Who Lives at Home,¡± opened in limited release.
¡°21 Jump Street¡± was forecast to pull in $28 million to $31 million, the estimates of Box Office Guru and Box Office.com. The film¡¯s ¡°R¡± rating may limit its appeal, according to Gitesh Pandya, editor of Box Office Guru.
¡°This is a great opening for Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, and it helps that this was the only new film in wide release,¡± said Jeff Bock, a box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations Co. in Los Angeles, in a telephone interview.
¡°21 Jump Street¡± features Hill and Tatum as a pair of young cops sent to a local high school to blend in and bring down a synthetic drug ring. The original series, a TV drama, ran from 1987 to 1991, according to the Internet Movie Database.
The film isn¡¯t so much a send-up of ¡¯80s cop shows as a send-up of movies that send up ¡¯80s cop shows, Bloomberg critic Greg Evans said in his review.

Production credits for the picture include Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. and Ryan Kavanaugh¡¯s Relativity Media LLC, according to IMDB. The film was made for an estimated $42 million, according to film researcher Box Office Mojo.
In ¡°The Lorax,¡± written by the children¡¯s author Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, a 12-year-old boy battles to win the affection of a girl and restore nature in his overly industrialized world.
In the process, he learns the story of the Lorax, an acerbic creature who tried to save trees from developers. The computer-animated film features the voices of Danny DeVito, Taylor Swift and Zac Efron. The film has taken in $158.4 million since it opened on March 2.
Among other returning films, Walt Disney Co.¡¯s big-budget film ¡°John Carter¡± collected $13.6 million in its second weekend, falling to third place from second.
The film, produced at an estimated cost of $250 million, according to IMDB.com, tells the story of an American Civil War veteran who suddenly finds himself on Mars. Empowered with great strength because of the planet¡¯s lighter gravity, he joins in a conflict among its inhabitants.
¡®A Thousand Words¡¯
¡°Project X,¡± the R-rated teen comedy from Time Warner Inc.¡¯s Warner Bros., had $4 million in receipts in its third week, placing fourth. The film, which follows three high-school seniors as they plan a birthday party that explodes into a drug-fueled bash, has taken in $48.2 million since opening.
¡°That has been a huge boon for Warner Bros.,¡± Bock said. ¡°They¡¯re already talking about making a sequel.¡±
Eddie Murphy¡¯s ¡°A Thousand Words¡± earned $3.6 million to finish in sixth place. The comedian plays a slippery literary agent who falls under a curse that limits the number of words he has left to speak. The film from Viacom Inc.¡¯s Paramount Pictures also features Alison Janney and Clark Duke.
Revenue Up Slightly
¡°Casa de mi Padre¡± opened with sales of $2.3 million in 382 theaters, to finish in ninth place. The comedy, distributed in the U.S. by Pantelion Films, a partnership of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and Grupo Televisa SAB, features Ferrell as the son of a cash-strapped Mexican rancher. He battles a drug lord after his younger brother¡¯s financial rescue plan turns out to be trouble.
Opening in 254 theaters, ¡°Jeff, Who Lives at Home¡± collected $855,000 in sales for the Paramount Vantage label. It finished 17th in the rankings.

35,Buffett Acolyte Donates $2.11 Million as Thank You,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 24 (Bloomberg) -- Zhao Danyang, the hedge fund manager who paid more than $2.11 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett, said he owed his firm¡¯s 600 percent return over the past six years to lessons he learned from the Oracle of Omaha.
Zhao, general manager of Pureheart Asset Management Co. in Hong Kong, credited a book he read on Buffett during the Asian financial crisis a decade ago with changing his investment philosophy. He said the record-breaking bid in Buffett¡¯s charity auction last year was his way of saying thank you.
¡°Buffett is my teacher,¡± he said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday. ¡°In my heart, I am really thankful to him.¡±
Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the world¡¯s most celebrated investor, met a group assembled by Zhao for lunch today at Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Manhattan. Zhao¡¯s bid last year was three times the previous record for the lunch, and the largest ever for an EBay Inc.-sponsored charity auction. The proceeds benefit the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco-based charity where Buffett¡¯s late wife volunteered.
¡°It was a great lunch and they were great people,¡± Buffett said as he emerged from the steakhouse after the three-hour meal. He declined to list the topics the group discussed. ¡°That¡¯s what they paid $2.1 million for,¡± he said. ¡°I can¡¯t give it to you for free.¡±
Lifetime Benefit
Zhao brought his wife, son and friends to the steakhouse today, and said afterward the value of the experience ¡°can¡¯t be measured by money.¡± He said Buffett¡¯s advice would ¡°benefit me for my whole life,¡± and that he would be a more confident investor as a result. Two of the friends shouldered a portion of the cost of the lunch, he said, but it was ¡°mostly me.¡±
Winners typically wait a year before dining with Buffett. This year¡¯s bidding is in its fourth day on EBay¡¯s auction site, and is set to close June 26. The price hit $135,678 at 4:30 p.m. New York time after 56 bids. In past years, bidders waited until the last minutes of the auction before driving up the price.
Buffett, ranked the world¡¯s second-richest man by Forbes magazine, transformed Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire from a failing textile maker into an enterprise with businesses ranging from ice cream and underwear to power plants. His investing acumen earned him the ¡°Oracle of Omaha¡± nickname. Berkshire shareholders come from around the globe to fill that city¡¯s Qwest Center arena at the firm¡¯s annual meeting each year.
Investment manager Mohnish Pabrai said in an interview he and his friend Guy Spier covered 54 topics in three hours with Buffett after winning the 2007 auction with a $650,100 bid.
¡°I got more than my money¡¯s worth,¡± he said.
¡®Down and Out¡¯
Glide, founded in the 1960s by the Rev. Cecil Williams, provides job training, medical care, counseling and other services for the homeless, the HIV-positive and victims of domestic violence. It feeds the needy three times a day. The number of meals it served increased 17 percent in the 12 months ended in May compared with the prior year.
¡°They help tens of thousands of people, and they believe everybody has a future and every life is as important as every other life,¡± Buffett said in a separate interview with Bloomberg Television today.
Alan Stillman, the founder of Smith & Wollensky, is donating $10,000 to Glide for the right to host the event. He said today that he entered his own unsuccessful bid on the lunch two years ago.

36,"China's Stocks Drop to 22-Month Low; Jiangxi Copper, Citic Fall","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- China's stocks fell, driving the benchmark index to a 22-month low, as commodity producers and airlines declined on concern the global economy is headed for a recession that will curb Chinese exports.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China's second-biggest producer of the metal, slumped by the maximum 10 percent as copper and zinc dropped by the limit for a second day on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Air China Ltd., the nation's largest international carrier, tumbled 10 percent after forecasting a nine-month loss. Citic Securities Co. slid 7.7 percent after a fourth rival said profit plunged.
The CSI 300 Index, which tracks yuan-denominated A shares listed on China's two exchanges, sank 93.45, or 4.9 percent, to 1,820.90 at the close, the lowest close since December 2006. Only 23 stocks rose on the 300-member measure. Declines followed a 9.1 percent drop in the U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 Index yesterday, the most since the crash of 1987.
``We are facing both domestic and global economic uncertainty,'' said Fan Dizhao, an investment manager at Guotai Asset Management Co. in Shanghai, which oversees the equivalent of $5.1 billion. ``It remains to be seen whether negative factors have mostly been priced into the decline.'' Fan would not say whether he's buying or selling.
Consumer purchases in the U.S. fell 1.2 percent in September, almost twice analysts' estimates, a government report said yesterday. The drop marked the third-straight monthly decline, the first time that's happened since comparable records began in 1992, U.S. Commerce Department figures showed.
Dow Tumbles
The CSI 300 has slumped 66 percent this year, making it Asia's worst-performing benchmark index. Economies in the U.S. and Europe are slowing as the global credit crisis stifles lending and causes financial institutions to collapse.
Exports accounted for 22 percent of China's economic growth last year. The economy, the world's fourth largest, expanded 10.1 percent in the second quarter, the slowest pace since 2005. UBS AG said Oct. 6 it reduced its estimate for China's growth in 2009 to 8 percent from 8.8 percent.
Jiangxi Copper slumped 10 percent to 10.43 yuan. Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co., China's biggest copper producer, lost 9.3 percent to 5.77 yuan. Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co., China's biggest producer of refined zinc, retreated 8.5 percent to 4.21 yuan.
Copper for January delivery dropped 4 percent to 39,590 yuan ($5,797) a ton in Shanghai. January-delivery of zinc in Shanghai also tumbled by its limit to 11,120 yuan a ton.
Air China plunged 10 percent to 4.67 yuan. The carrier said it probably had a nine-month loss because of higher fuel costs and disruptions caused by natural disasters and restrictions during the Olympic Games. The carrier will also book a loss from bets on fuel prices after recent drops in the price of oil, it said.
Citic Securities
China Southern Airlines Co., the nation's biggest carrier by fleet size, lost 9.2 percent to 3.15 yuan. China Eastern Airlines Corp., the third-largest, slid 10 percent to 3.58 yuan.
Citic Securities tumbled 7.7 percent to 18.29 yuan. Changjiang Securities Co., the country's fourth-biggest brokerage, fell 9.4 percent to 12.30 yuan. Hong Yuan Securities Co., China's first publicly traded brokerage, slumped 10 percent to 13.44 yuan.
Changjiang Securities said nine-month profit probably fell as much as 70 percent from a year ago and Hong Yuan Securities said profit for the period dropped about 78 percent.
The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China's stock exchanges, fell 4.3 percent to 1,909.94. The Shenzhen Composite Index dropped 4.7 percent to 500.30.
The following companies were among the most active in China's markets. Stock symbols are in brackets after companies' names.
PetroChina Co. (601857 CH), the nation's biggest oil company, fell 0.07 yuan, or 0.6 percent, to 11.90. Parent China National Petroleum Corp.'s pretax profit fell 28 percent to 98.98 billion yuan in the first nine months of this year, the Nanfang Daily reported, citing unidentified company officials.
Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. (600000 CH), the Chinese partner of Citigroup Inc., slid 0.76 yuan, or 5.5 percent, to 13.16. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. sold shares in the Chinese bank this month to boost profit, Shanghai Securities News said, citing a person it didn't identify. Ping An, China's second-biggest insurer, dropped 2.37 yuan, or 8.3 percent, to 26.30 yuan.

38,$3 Billion of Unpaid Bills Fails to Deter Sugar Farmers in India,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sugar production in India will probably exceed demand for a sixth year as farmers maintain plantings in spite of the $3.2 billion they¡¯re owed by mills.
Output in the 12 months starting Oct. 1 may match the 28 million metric tons estimated for this year, according to the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd. The crop was planted on 3.9 million hectares (9.6 million acres) as of April 22, almost the same as 4 million hectares a year earlier, government data show.
The largest producer after Brazil is poised for another bumper year as prices set by state governments make sugar one of the most profitable crops for farmers. Mills are racking up debt to the growers as the price they sell to the local market doesn¡¯t cover their raw material costs, the Indian Sugar Mills Association says. As the government announces steps to help mills clear their debt, farmers are sticking with the crop.
¡°Cane is just like a hen that lays golden eggs,¡± said Dhanbir Shastri, a farmer from Rasoolpur village in Uttar Pradesh, the biggest cane-growing state. ¡°There¡¯s no alternative to sugar, as the return from rice or potatoes doesn¡¯t even cover the cost of production. We are sure that arrears will be cleared with government help.¡±
While Shastri has yet to be paid about 125,000 rupees ($1,966) by a mill for this year¡¯s crop, he recently received the money owed to him for the previous harvest. That helped the 61-year-old farmer plant cane on half of his four-acre farm.
Deepening Losses
Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar Ltd., Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd. and Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. have reported losses for at least three straight quarters as states fix cane rates to help farmers. Mills nationwide owe growers 201 billion rupees, according to official data.
The gap between raw material costs and sugar prices threatens the financial status of mills and will turn India into a producer with a structural surplus, said Tom McNeill, a director at Brisbane, Australia-based Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty. The government will have to continue to support the industry with tax-payer money, said McNeill, who has studied the commodity for more than two decades and was the head of analysis at Kingsman SA.
¡°Cane now pays better than any other crop, because the government continues to raise the price every year, ignoring what the market is doing,¡± McNeill said in e-mailed responses to questions from Bloomberg on April 29. ¡°The question many are asking is why not align cane prices with market returns rather than allow the government to set them.¡±
Six-Year Low
Prices in New York have fallen in the past four years, the longest stretch of declines since at least 1962, and touched 11.91 cents a pound on March 31, the lowest since January 2009. Futures were at 12.56 cents on ICE Futures U.S. on Tuesday. Refined sugar prices fell as much as 0.6 percent to 2,409 rupees per 100 kilograms on the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange in Mumbai, the lowest since April 21.
Global production in the 12 months ending Sept. 30 will exceed demand by 620,000 tons, data from London-based International Sugar Organization show.
Higher cane costs mean sugar prices in India are above global rates, making exports uneconomical even with a government subsidy of 4,000 rupees a ton, according to the mills association. The government has announced interest-free loans and increased import duties to boost prices and help mills clear the debt to farmers.
Government Support
¡°We hope the government will continue to support farmers and the industry,¡± said M.G. Joshi, managing director of the cooperative federation, which represents mills producing 48 percent of the country¡¯s sugar. ¡°The farmers feel secure with cane irrespective of the arrears as the price is assured and it is increasing each year.¡±
Production will climb to as much as 28 million tons in the 12 months ending Sept. 30 this year, the mills association estimates. That would be the highest since a record 28.4 million tons in 2006-2007, the group¡¯s data show. The association sees local consumption of 25 million tons in 2015-2016 after 24.8 million tons this year.
Planting will end by mid-May, said Avdhesh Mishra, president of the Cane Committees¡¯ Association of Uttar Pradesh. ¡°Every year yield and recovery are increasing, so it doesn¡¯t matter even if sowing falls by a few thousand hectares.¡±"
39,¡®3-D Hurricane¡¯ Bears Down on Developed World: Chart of the Day,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 29 (Bloomberg) -- There¡¯s a ¡°3-D hurricane¡± coming to the U.S. and other developed countries that will limit economic growth and market returns for years, according to Jason Hsu, chief investment officer at Research Affiliates LLC.
Hsu used the phrase to characterize the nations¡¯ mounting debts, sustained deficit spending and demographic shifts to an older population, as outlined in a report last week.
The CHART OF THE DAY depicts what¡¯s heading for the U.S. economy. As the top panel shows, the debt burden of households, businesses and government has increased and federal budget gaps have widened since 2001. The bottom panel tracks a decline in the number of workers for each recipient of Social Security.
¡°Ben Bernanke in a helicopter will not stop the hurricane¡¯s devastating path,¡± Hsu wrote, referring to the Federal Reserve chairman¡¯s study of monetary policy alternatives that economist Milton Friedman likened to dropping money from a copter. ¡°More stimulus packages will not stop it. Blaming the Chinese for lending us too much money will not stop it.¡±
The storm will leave developed countries with the ¡°new normal¡± that Pacific Investment Management Co., the world¡¯s biggest bond-fund manager, predicted two years ago, according to Hsu. They will also have to cope with higher inflation rates, increased borrowing costs and falling currency values, he wrote.
Emerging economies will be increasingly responsible for global growth, in his view, as debt, deficits and demographics work in their favor. They are likely to become more creditworthy than many developed countries ¡°in short order,¡± the report said.

40,"$300 for a Balloon? Yes, But This Old One Tracks Down Storms","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
When the latest computer forecast models couldn¡¯t figure out where major Hurricane Joaquin was headed earlier this month, the National Weather Service ordered extra launches of one of its oldest tools -- the weather balloon.
Twice a day, in what may be the world¡¯s largest act of international cooperation, crews at about 850 weather offices around the globe walk outside and set loose balloons at precisely the same time.
In an age of satellites, radar, jet aircraft and high-speed computers, a method of gathering weather data that became routine more than 80 years ago would seem outdated. Not so, said William Blackmore, meteorologist with the National Weather Service¡¯s upper-air observation program.
While all the modern advances are crucial tools for forecasting, weather balloons can do something all the rest cannot: measure the atmosphere from the surface to about 115,000 feet (35 kilometers) every second, he said.
¡°What makes it unique is that it¡¯s providing information every 15 to 20 feet,¡± Blackmore said. ¡°At the present time, that can¡¯t be beat.¡±
Twice-Daily Launches
In the U.S., 92 weather service offices make the twice-daily launches, sending the balloons, usually hydrogen-filled, into the atmosphere, Blackmore said. With a few extra launches thrown in, the U.S. alone sends about 70,000 to 75,000 balloons skyward annually. Each balloon sounding, including labor, maintenance and parts, costs about $300.
Around the world, there are 1,300 sites where balloons can be launched, though only about two-thirds of them take part in the daily sampling, according to the World Meteorological Organization¡¯s website. That is about 620,500 balloons per year. This may be why so many U.F.O. reports have been dismissed as weather balloons over the years.
The idea of reaching into the sky to see what¡¯s going on up there has been around longer than humans have been able to get airborne.
Kites carrying thermometers were first used in Europe in 1749. In 1885, the U.S.¡¯s Henry Allen Hazen rode balloons above the Earth¡¯s surface to take observations, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration¡¯s website.
Kites First
Outside Boston, at theÂ  Blue Hill Observatory, 19th-century researchers sent a kite 2,030 feet above sea level on Aug. 4, 1894, the organization¡¯s website said. By 1898, kites were being used across the U.S.
¡°If you look at a kite, it could make a very good platform,¡± Blackmore said. ¡°The problem with the kite is you need wind and they could only go so high.¡±
By 1909 the kite was out and the balloon was in. In 1938, balloons started carrying radiosondes, packages of instruments that measure the weather and radio the information back to the surface. This allowed meteorologists to gather data from as high as 100,000 feet.
With a few technological improvements, such as global positioning satellite data, the same system is in place today.
Vital Data
After being radioed to ground bases, the information the balloons gather -- air pressure, wind speed, temperature -- is fed into computer models along with data from other sources to help forecasters predict the weather.
Blackmore said the balloons are about 5 feet across when launched and swell to more than 20 feet by the time they reach about 115,000 feet. The lower air pressure at the extreme altitude eventually causes the balloon to burst.
Protected in a plastic or Styrofoam case, the radiosonde parachutes back to the ground where, forecasters hope, someone will come along to find it and mail it back to the weather service. The radiosonde has a message written on it explaining what it is, plus a postage paid mail pouch.
Fewer than 20 percent are refurbished and flown again, Blackmore said.
Even so, that¡¯s equipment the weather service can¡¯t do without.
Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal."
41,"Azeri $34 Billion Fund to Remake Holdings After Aussie, Gold","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 15 (Bloomberg) -- Azerbaijan¡¯s State Oil Fund is weighing expansion into new currencies to reflect the impact of faster growing economies after starting to buy Australian dollars and gold last year, its chief investment officer said.
With $34.1 billion in assets on Jan. 1, equivalent to almost 50 percent of the Caspian Sea nation¡¯s economy, the fund, known as Sofaz, has broadened its mandate to keep as much as 5 percent of its assets in Australian dollars, Russian rubles and Turkish lira, Israfil Mammadov said in a March 13 interview in the capital, Baku.
¡°Sofaz is constantly exploring new currencies with a view of further diversification of its investment portfolio,¡± Mammadov said. ¡°If we start investing in new currencies, the weight of our existing currencies will of course diminish.¡±
The former Soviet Union¡¯s biggest oil producer after Russia and Kazakhstan is expanding its currency allocation for the first time since its establishment in 1999 and diversifying reserves by adding investments in real estate and gold. The price of oil has more than quadrupled over the past 10 years, raising the revenue of exporting countries such as Azerbaijan and Norway.
The Azeri wealth fund, which manages all state revenue from oil and natural gas, increased assets 15 percent in 2012 from the previous year. It¡¯s overseen by a supervisory board and reports to President Ilham Aliyev, according to its website.
Ruble, Lira
Sofaz¡¯s holdings were kept in euros, U.S. dollars and British pounds before 2012, when it began investing in other currencies, gold and real estate. At the end of February, the fund had the equivalent of $470 million in lira assets, with $209 million in Australian dollars and $100 million in Russian rubles.
¡°Azerbaijan has very close ties with these neighboring countries, and we know those markets well,¡± Mammadov said. ¡°Of course we also look into the economic situation and investment opportunities in those countries as well. Both Turkey and Russia are rapidly developing economies, major emerging markets.¡±
Central bank holdings denominated in dollars, pounds, euros and yen made up 94.4 percent of the $5.6 trillion of allocated reserves as of 2011, compared with 98.4 percent in 2001, according to International Monetary Fund data. Central bank claims in other currencies rose to $297 billion from $20.1 billion during the decade that ended in 2011, the figures show.
The Washington-based lender said in November that it¡¯s considering classifying the Australian and the Canadian dollars as reserve currencies.
Euro Destination
The euro-area debt crisis hasn¡¯t eroded the common currency¡¯s appeal, with the bloc set to remain a ¡°major part of the global economy and, as such, an important destination for investment from institutional investors like us,¡± Mammadov said.
Plans by the European Union¡¯s eastern members to revive their bids to join the currency union will further boost the euro¡¯s prospects, according to Sofaz. Latvia and Lithuania plan to seek euro adoption in 2015, with Poland reiterating plans to make the switch later. In the former communist east, Slovenia, Slovakia and Estonia already use the currency.
Euro, Poland
¡°The size of the euro market will increase substantially with the joining of new countries like Poland,¡± Mammadov said. ¡°In the long term, this could be beneficial for the euro in general.¡±
Sofaz, which began gold purchases in the first quarter of last year and has bought 17.4 metric tons as of March 1, targets keeping 5 percent of holdings in the precious metal, he said.
The Azeri fund is also seeking to broaden its investments in real estate after buying properties in London, Paris and Moscow last year, with plans to pursue acquisitions in Southeast Asia and Turkey, according to Mammadov. Sofaz, which spent about $600 million on real estate in 2012, wants to allocate about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, or 5 percent of its portfolio, for property investment, he said.
¡°The current priority is countries of Southeast Asia,¡± Mammadov said. ¡°When it comes to our real estate investment strategy it is aimed at investing in core, prime office space in key capitals with high market transparency, depth, liquidity, landlord-friendly laws and the practice of very long leases.¡±
$10 Billion
State-run wealth funds from China to Norway made 38 property investments valued at almost $10 billion in 2012, according to the Sovereign Investment Lab at Bocconi University in Milan, accounting for 21 percent of all sovereign fund investments last year, the highest percentage on record and topping the 2011 high of 16 percent.
Sofaz will also allocate financing for energy projects in the region including the proposed Trans-Anatolia Pipeline, or Tanap to deliver Caspian natural gas to Europe via Turkey, Mammadov said.
Azerbaijan and Turkey agreed in June to build the 2,000-kilometer (1,300 mile) link for an estimated $7 billion to $10 billion. State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar, holds 80 percent of Tanap with the remaining 20 percent held by Turkey¡¯s government pipeline company Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS, or Botas, and Turkiye Petrolleri AO.
The fund will spend 86.4 million manat ($110 million) this year for the Azeri government¡¯s share of the Tanap link and also plans to finance the Star refinery in Turkey¡¯s Izmir region, a petrochemical complex in Azerbaijan and construction of offshore drilling rigs for use in the Caspian sea, according to Mammadov.

If oil hits $40, Russia is in trouble.
Already faced with recession and sanctions, a further drop in crude might force the country's central bank into an emergency rate hike ? after four cuts already this yearÂ ?Â  according to 65 percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg from July 24-29. Thirty-nine percentÂ of analystsÂ said the government might impose Greek-like capital controls and 22 percent predicted a takeover ofÂ at least some of the country's banks.
When asked about the central bank's own analysis of the $40-per-barrel oil scenario, which found a roughly 600 billion ruble capital deficit and two-fold increase in the share of non-performing loans, 69 percent of economists said it has accurately estimated the risks to the Russian economy and banking sector.
The impact on growth from $40 oil would be particularly severe, weakening the ruble to 65 againstÂ theÂ U.S. dollar by end-2015 and causing the economy to contract by 5 percent this year and 1 percent in 2016. Compare that to the far less pessimisticÂ baseline consensusÂ provided byÂ Bloomberg's monthlyÂ economic survey, which currently forecasts a 3.5 percent contraction in 2015 and a 0.5 percent expansion in 2016.
Even with oil trading closer to $50Â per barrel, economists see anÂ 83 percent probability of recession in the next 12 months. That's downÂ from 95 percent last month but still marks the twelfth month that the indicator has stoodÂ above the 50 percent mark.Â 
On the sanctions front, only 28 percent of respondents said the EU willÂ begin lifting existing asset freezes and travel bansÂ during the next year, down from 52 percent who said the same in May.
Just oneÂ economist expects the U.S. to lift its sanctions in the next 12 months."
44,400 Billion Reasons Why Ebbing Currency Reserves Threaten Bonds,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
There¡¯s a $400 billion reason to worry if you¡¯re a bond investor.
That¡¯s how much global currency reserves have shrunk since reaching a record $12 trillion last August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The decline is another potential source of volatility in debt markets rocked this week in part by ebbing deflation fears in Europe and speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates.
That¡¯s because contracting reserves leave countries with less money to recycle into bonds, removing a key support, strategists at Montreal-based brokerage Pavilion Global Markets Ltd., said in a note sent to clients on Thursday and titled ¡°Falling Reserves, Rising Yields.¡±
Periods of falling reserves historically coincided with increased fixed-income volatility, as measured by a market stress indicator created by the ECB and based on fluctuations in the German 10-year bond, according to the Pavilion team, led by Pierre Lapointe.
Bond markets jumped in both 2008 and 2011, the same times as the combined reserves of China, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Switzerland were dipping by Pavilion¡¯s reckoning.
¡°We expect this time to be no different,¡± Lapointe and colleagues wrote, predicting a more skittish bond market will also cause equities and currencies to trade more wildly.
Furthermore, they found recent outflows from Europe¡¯s bond market correlate with monthly declines in China¡¯s foreign-exchange reserves, which have fallen to $3.7 trillion from a peak of $4 trillion last June.
Emerging markets exiting European debt ¡°could explain the recent move in bund yields despite underwhelming data and continued Greek drama,¡± the Pavilion strategists wrote."
45,$400 Yoga Pants Are Just the Beginning,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feeding off the rise of workout gear that can be worn in or out of the gym, activewear labels have become status symbols, much like any other pricey designer clothes. Premium yoga pants, made popular amongst the masses by Lululemon, can run anywhere from $80 to $200. A horde of brands battle each other in this segment as upstarts such asÂ Outdoor Voices, Michi, and Vie Active jostle with superpowers Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas.
Yet there's little available for women searching the racks for even more expensive, higher-end performance wear. Fear not, luxury shoppers. It won't remain like this for long.Â 
Quietly, a smattering of new true luxury activewear labels have appeared, each with the hope that affluent shoppers are willing to shell out $300, $400, or more on a pair of pliable pants. Think about it this way: If you're a luxury shopper who buys $1,500 designer dresses, pays $250 a month for an Equinox gym membership, and totes around a $4,000 Chanel bag, why would you spend a mere $100 on the leggings that you wear to the gym, on errands, and on the weekend?

¡°Some of the newer brands that are emerging are going to give activewear a whole level of status we haven¡¯t seen in this business before,¡± says Roseanne Morrison, fashion director at trend intelligence firm Doneger Group.Â The ¡°designer casual¡± look is prominent these days, championed by luxe labels like Brunello Cuccinelli and Isabel Marant. Once dismissed by couture circles as unworthy, luxury fashion houses started selling some adapted forms of fitness wear,Â using their longtime reputations to justify selling $400 jersey leggings. The next phase involves specialized companies touting luxury leggings under new performance-centric brands, says Morrison.Â 
Take Charli Cohen, who launched her eponymousÂ activewear line straight out of college in 2013. After graduating from Kingston University in 2012, the young British designer went into fitness fashion immediately because she saw technical sportswear as the next big thing. Now she sells leggings, tops, and jackets that run for $300 or more, targeting women who spend a lot of money on their eveningwear wardrobe who want equally chic, quality garments for the gym.
Thus far, Cohen has pushed hard to present her designs in a fashion context, rather than pigeonholing herself asÂ an athletic brand. It¡¯s difficult to prove yourself as a fashion label, said Cohen, because you¡¯re limited on shapesÂ and can¡¯t get cheap exposure by outfittingÂ a celebrity on a red carpet. She¡¯s currently working on her next collection, which will be showcased in New York before hitting a catwalk in London this fall. ¡°You still need to be able to show people that there is that gym-to-daywear crossover,¡± says Cohen. ¡°If anything, you need to push the fashion side harder because the fitness side is already assumed.¡±
After a career designing for the likes of Alexander McQueen and Mark Jacobs,Â AnjheÂ Mules took a leap in 2010, starting her own luxury activewear label, Lucas Hugh. It took two years of research and development to ready the brand for launch?Â a marriage of fashion and function, says Mules. Lucas Hugh is sold in such swanky department stores as Bergdorf Goodman and luxury marketplace Net-a-Porter, right alongside legacy fashion labels. Mules uses heat-sealed seams all over her garments, the type of technology used in Olympic swimsuits. The pants wick moisture, dry quickly, resists UVs, and can cost more than $400.

One of the most recent entrants is Callens, which founder Claire-Anne Stroll launched in September during fashion week in Milan.Â A pair of leggings from the Italian label costsÂ nearly $500?a price Stroll said her customers are willing to pay for fine craftsmanship, without much persuading. ""I¡¯ve never actually thought about convincing customers,"" she says. ""When you see the product, its superior quality and value comes across so clearly.""
Luxury activewear labels once devoted to single sports are also recognizing the power of the overall fitness market. Monreal, a tennis brand that released its first capsule collection in 2013, offers up sophisticated dresses that promise functionality with a fashion spin. Some of its most recent goods aren¡¯t focused on the courts, however, as the company started to adapt the technology from its stretch-jersey tennis track pants for other purposes. One such item is a $340 performance legging for ¡°running, pilates, kickboxing, yoga and more,¡± sold at upscale department store Saks Fifth Avenue. Though she plans to stay loyal to her tennis roots, designer Stefani Grosse says she see limitless opportunities to grow in the broader fitness world. ¡°That¡¯s really the future, and it¡¯s a big market,¡± she says.Â 
Indeed, U.S.Â activewear sales are up 9 percent in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the same period lastÂ year, according to data from NPD Group. The total market clocks in at around $35 billion as of October, NPD reported.Â 
Once solely geared toward tennis, Monreal is beginning to sell gear meant for all kinds of workouts. Courtesy Monreal London
Demand for luxury activewearÂ is bolstered by the culture of fancy boutique workouts such as SoulCycle and Pure Barre, saysÂ Caletha Crawford, a professor at Parsons New School for Design. Women care about how they look when spinning or on the mat doing yoga or pilates, she says, and they're looking for items to elevateÂ their status.
Still,Â sportswear remains burdened by a longtime fashion industry stigma?neglected as utilitarian clothing better served by companies like Puma and Reebok than on the haute couture runways of Paris and Milan. Yet it's possible to overcome this. In the early 2000s, another pragmatic pant found itself enjoying a designer craze: jeans. Fashion houses such as Dolce & Gabbana and Roberto Cavalli sold some denim styles for $1,200. All sorts of fancy niches popped up, such as Japanese selvedge denim and sustainable, organic denim.
How expensive can yoga pants and leggings get? High-end sportswear exists in certain circles of the fashion industry. Take skiwear, which requires performance to be embedded in the garment, lest the wearer freeze. Swiss label Mover touts luxurious insulation and elegance with its high-end ski clothes, with price tags to back up its splendor: A pair of wool-lined shell ski pants can cost nearly $1,000.Â But in order to get people to pay those kinds of prices for workout pants, a serious amount of education is needed, says Crawford. Without explaining to customers why the technical fabrics, the better fit, or the chic aesthetics matter, it¡¯s impossible to get shoppers to drop a tallÂ stack of cash on a gymÂ item. ¡°I need to understand why I¡¯m paying more than for Lululemon,¡± she says."
46,"$409,000 Sofa Caps Arad¡¯s Rise From Wrecked Car Seat: Interview","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 1 (Bloomberg) -- Ron Arad was on a lunch break in 1981 when he made what was a smart career move.
Bored by his architecture job, Arad headed for a scrap yard in north London, yanked away two leather seats from a Rover car, and made armchairs out of them.
¡°At that time, I didn¡¯t know that this action was going to suck me into the world of design, but it did,¡± he recalls.
The worn-out Rover Chair opens Arad¡¯s retrospective at London¡¯s Barbican Centre (through May 16). Two floors are filled with Arad¡¯s three-dimensional doodles: sculptural contraptions that serve as seating or shelving, and straddle the worlds of art and design.
Gray-bearded Arad and I settle on an electric-blue sofa with pieces that fit together like a puzzle. He wears a comical hat of his own design -- a felt cap with a flipped-over brim -- and displays the same playful humor in conversation.
The Barbican show comes after surveys of his work at Paris¡¯s Pompidou Center and New York¡¯s Museum of Modern Art, rare tributes for a designer. While Arad has successfully infiltrated the museum world, design is still shown separately at fairs, not where the art is.
¡°Who is it that makes the rules that you can use cows in art fairs, and you¡¯re not allowed to use things that might suggest some function?¡± he says, an oblique reference to Damien Hirst¡¯s pickled cattle. ¡°Art is an open field, and it should include everything.¡±
London Bound
Arad was born in Tel-Aviv, studied art at an academy in Jerusalem, then landed in London in 1973. He graduated from London¡¯s Architectural Association.
Of the Rover Chair that jumpstarted his career, he made hundreds of copies -- including a few bought by French fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier -- then stopped when sales were at a peak. ¡°I thought, ¡®I¡¯m not going to just be a Rover car-seat merchant,¡¯¡± he says.
Arad has created many more cult pieces since -- including Bookworm, a snake-like wall-mounted bookshelf with built-in bookends; and the Tom Vac chair, with a curving, partially hollowed back that is now copied in China.
¡°When they stop copying you, that¡¯s when you should start worrying,¡± he says. ¡°I congratulate them on their taste.¡±
Arad¡¯s furniture has also cropped up on U.K. television programs: the Rover Chair on ¡°Top Gear,¡± a popular car show; the Victoria and Albert sofa on reality-TV show ¡°Big Brother.¡±
¡°I have to force myself not to be upset by it,¡± Arad says of the Big Brother accolade. ¡°It¡¯s not something I¡¯ll put on my CV.¡± The V&A sofa, he hastens to add, is also used by travelers at London Heathrow Airport and Hong Kong International Airport.
Steel Rust
This month, Arad¡¯s Design Museum opens in Holon, outside Tel-Aviv, with a roof featuring rust-colored bands of undulating weatherproof steel. Whether he designs more museums depends on if he¡¯s asked, he says.
For now, Arad is marveling at the reverence that his Rover Chair commands. The Pompidou Center curator had him wear white gloves to handle a seat that came straight out of his living room and that his two daughters long pounced on.
¡°It¡¯s pretty amazing that there weren¡¯t any labor pains to it,¡± he says of his maiden design. ¡°What you see up there in the room is, very simply, IT.¡±
Arad¡¯s Prices
During the boom in the Design-Art market, collectors paid a record auction price of $409,000 for Arad¡¯s stainless steel ¡°D-Sofa¡± (2003) at Phillips de Pury, New York, in 2007.
Two years later, amid the financial crisis, two Arad chairs -- Blo Void 4 (2006) and Big Easy Volume II (1988) -- went unsold against low estimates of 100,000 pounds and 50,000 pounds, respectively.
A new Arad design -- made in an edition of 100, partly to benefit the Barbican Art Gallery -- is now on sale for 5,000 pounds at the Barbican and the Timothy Taylor Gallery. ¡°Well Transparent Chair¡± (based on his 1986 ¡°Well Tempered Chair¡±) is made of see-through polycarbonate held together with wing nuts.
Arad¡¯s collectors sometimes worry that the rivets on a pair of jeans might scratch his metal furniture. His dealers dismiss any weight-bearing concerns over the ¡°Well Transparent Chair.¡±
¡°This is in many ways a conceptual piece,¡± says Oscar Humphries, a spokesman for Timothy Taylor. ¡°But you can sit on it.¡±

47,$430 Cowboy Boots and Other Reasons to Be Excited About Stocks,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Are you suffering from a chronic case of apathy toward the stock market?
The good news is you are not alone. Just take it from Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG:
""As many return to the office after a long weekend and the unofficial start of summer, it remains no less difficult to be excited about equity markets,"" Greenhaus wrote in a note to clients.
It sounds like Greenhaus had a pretty good weekend! In any event, whether you were lucky enough to squeeze in three rounds of golf and a sail or just cut the grass over the holiday, it's hard not to agree with his lack of excitement for stocks. Sam Stovall at Standard & Poor's compares the S&P 500 Index to a ""creeping vine"" as it slowly climbed to fresh records last week without much fanfare.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average today is snapping a six-session streak without a move of 100 points or more, its longest in a year, and the move is to the downside.Â After a vigorous six-year bull market, even the cheapest stocks are expensiveÂ at a time when earnings growth is scarce.Â Is this one of those instances where we'd all really be better off if we followed the old cliche and just sold in May and went away?
""Excluding the Tech Bubble, there are virtually no standalone metrics on which the S&P 500 looks inexpensive versus history,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist Savita Subramanian wrote in a note today.
Source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Still, she wrote, valuations are a terrible metric to time markets with in the short term since they don't tend to signal when it's the appropriate time to exit. They are, however, great predictors of long-term results. History suggests valuations at current levels will lead to a future annual return of 8 percent over the next 10 years compared with a 50-year total annual return of 10 percent for the S&P 500, she wrote. And while that's less than average, it should be enough to beat bonds and commodities: ""Among the various asset classes, equities appear well positioned to offer greater relative returns.""
Stovall pointed out that the whole ""sell in May and go away"" strategy does not look so hot when the S&P 500 posts a gain in May, as appears may be the case this month. In the past 69 years, the S&P 500 increased an average of only 1.3 percent during the May through October period and advanced in that six-month period 64 percent of the time, he wrote. The six-month gain almost tripled to 3.5 percent whenever the S&P 500 rose in May, he wrote, and the chance of gains over the period increased from 64 percent to 87 percent.
Today, that May advance doesn't appear to be as much of a sure thing as it did last week, with the S&P 500 trimming its gain for the month to less than 0.9Â percent from 1.9 percent on Friday. So check back in a few days to see if the market was able to pull itself up from its bootstraps and post a gain for the month.Â 
Speaking of boots (awkward segue alert), check out these bad boys!Â 
Â

These obviously aren't just any boots, they are authentic Dan Post Men's Cowboy Certified Everglades Caiman Boots found in the ""exotics"" section of the Boot Barn website. They cost $429.99. And how, you might ask, is the market for cowboy boots doing these days? Pretty darn good, partner, thanks for asking.
Shares of Boot Barn Holdings Inc. are up 27 percent this year through last week and 44 percent since the company went public in October. Boot Barn posted revenue growth of 48 percent in 2014 and 38 percent the year before that, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The pace is expected to moderate to 15 percent, or $399 million in full-year sales, when the company reports fiscal fourth quarter results on Thursday, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Still, analysts are bullish, with fiveÂ of the sixÂ who cover the stock rating Boot Barn the equivalent of a buy.Â 
Boot Barn is ""a compelling growth story with low risk and high potential reward,"" according to analyst Randal J. Konik and colleagues at Jefferies. The company ""occupies its own unique niche, which allows it to face minimal competition, and is not subject to significant fashion risk.""
Hmm, fair enough. Though the line about ""not subject to significant fashion risk"" does make you wonder if Konik has seen this particular pair.Â Â "

In Brazil, bigger isn¡¯t always better when it comes to stock investing.
While the nation¡¯s five biggest money managers -- Banco do Brasil SA, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA, Caixa Economica Federal and Banco Santander Brasil SA --Â control more than 60 percent of all assets under management, just one of the group¡¯s Brazilian equity funds ranks among the 25 top-performing portfolios, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Instead, independent managers not associated with big retail banks are posting the best results.
The reason the smaller shops say they outperform their bigger peers is simple: They have to. In Brazil, retail investors are still scarce and they almost always choose the managers affiliated with the bank where they keep their checking accounts, said Richard Ziliotto, a managing partner at Taler, a family office, and a director of capital-markets association Anbima.
¡°It¡¯s a matter of survival,"" he said from Sao Paulo. ¡°Because of the convenience of being able to invest through their regular bank, the client that doesn¡¯t notice that the difference in returns can be gigantic over time because of compound interest just checks the products on the shelves and follows their branch manager¡¯s opinion. It¡¯s an almost automatic process.¡±
Among the best-performing Brazil-focused equity funds adjusted for volatility in the past 12 months, only one Banco do Brasil portfolio appeared in the top 25, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Of the 25 worst-performing funds, two belonged to the asset-management arms of Brazil¡¯s big managers: Itau and Santander Brasil. Bradesco and Caixa equity funds posted results somewhere in the middle.
Itau¡¯s fund that ranked among the worst performers is a passive dividend fund, while Santander¡¯s fund is a small-cap fund.
The Banco do Brasil fund that ranked among the best performers invests in exporters or companies that have relevant subsidiaries abroad, such as meatpackers and pulp producers that have benefited from a 30 percent depreciation in the real this year.
""The external scenario has been more favorable than the domestic,"" Jorge Ricca, executive manager for equity funds at Banco do Brasil, said from Rio de Janeiro. ""The companies in this fund have benefited a lot from the depreciation of the real lately, but we don¡¯t expect further declines for the currency at the same pace that we¡¯ve seen.""
The press offices for Itau, Bradesco and Santander Brasil declined to comment, while the office of Caixa didn¡¯t respond to multiple requests for comment.
Together, the five biggest managers oversee 1.78 trillion reais ($470 billion) in assets, including stocks and fixed income, according to Anbima. The remaining 1.05 trillion reais in assets in Brazil are split by 528 registered mid-sized and small managers, not all of whom have equity portfolios. Brazil¡¯s benchmark Ibovespa stock index is down 5 percent this year.
James Gulbrandsen, a partner at Rio de Janeiro-based NCH Capital, which manages $3.2 billion in assets, said in addition to having to post better results to lure clients, many independent managers have their own money on the line, too. He said he has 80 percent of his net worth tied up in his funds.
¡°That¡¯s why we¡¯re so competitive,¡± he said. ¡°Employees of a huge bank may not have the same level of personal commitment.¡±

49,$486 Billion Fund Says Samsung Burned Bridges in Activist Fight,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
The manager of the world¡¯s second-largest pension fund is siding with billionaire shareholder activist Paul Elliott Singer in his fight against Samsung Group.
Builder Samsung C&T Corp. burned a bridge with investors when it agreed this week to sell treasury shares to an ally to win support for a $9 billion merger, said Park Yoo-Kyung, a director at APG Groep NV. Though APG owns only 0.3 percent of C&T, it has influence given it manages more than 432 billion euros ($485 billion) of assets.
Treasury stock is ¡°not to be used as ammunition to protect controlling shareholders¡¯ control in the upcoming succession,¡± Park, director of sustainability and governance at APG¡¯s Asian asset management arm in Hong Kong, said in a Thursday interview. ¡°Are they listening to shareholders¡¯ concerns? They burned the bridge.¡±
Park said APG will vote against the offer from Samsung¡¯s de facto holding company, joining Singer¡¯s Elliott Associates LP in defying the controlling Lee family. The Lees have much riding on the deal as they seek to solidify control over South Korea¡¯s largest conglomerate amid a once-in-a-generation leadership transition.
Close Ally
Samsung C&T said Wednesday it will sell all its 8.99 million treasury shares, equal to a 5.8 percent stake, to KCC Corp., a construction material maker linked to the Hyundai conglomerate. Treasury shares are useless in a proxy contest since companies can¡¯t vote for themselves.
¡°KCC is not a good friend, because they have their own corporate governance problem -- they¡¯re not returning the cash to shareholders,¡± Park said. ¡°Getting help from them is not helpful for Samsung¡¯s image.¡±
Moody¡¯s Investors Service said on Friday KCC¡¯s purchase reinforces its concerns about the company¡¯s ¡°uncertain investment strategy.¡±
The sale, which unlocks voting rights the Lee family can use to push through the merger, brought an immediate legal challenge from Elliott. The activist investor, which opposes the bid by Cheil Industries Inc. as too low, called the disposal ¡°a desperate and unlawful attempt¡± by Samsung to strengthen support for the takeover effort.
Legal Challenge
The sale of treasury shares was a ¡°legitimate and fair move that was made with the best interests of the company and shareholders in mind,¡± Samsung C&T said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg queries.
¡°The board¡¯s decision to sell the treasury shares is to achieve diversification and synergy through the merger, protect the company and shareholders from hedge funds who seek short-term profits and secure funds to improve the company¡¯s financials,¡± Samsung C&T said.
Cheil Industries said it¡¯s inappropriate for the company to comment, as the issue is a matter between Samsung C&T and its shareholders. A Hong Kong-based external spokesman for Elliott declined to comment.
¡°The acquisition of Samsung C&T shares was a legitimate deal,¡± KCC said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg queries. ¡°In regards to Elliott¡¯s suit, we plan to take legal steps in response to that.¡±
APG manages retirement money for funds including Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, the world¡¯s second-largest pension fund with 373 billion euros of assets.

Marc Andreessen, who declared that software was eating the world in 2011 and that online-business services were the theme of 2012, has a new prediction for 2013: Cheap smartphones are going to connect the world.
""The $50 Android smartphone is about to hit the market worldwide,"" Andreessen, the Netscape co-founder turned venture capitalist, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. ""Smartphones are about to be put in the hands of another 3 billion people who don't have them. And that's probably the single biggest thing that's happening right now.""
A bargain-basement phone running Google's mobile operating system would enable poor people who can't afford today's smartphones, including those in emerging markets, to finally have regular Internet access, according to Andreessen, a founder of Andreessen Horowitz. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg.com, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz.

51,MF Global Customer Says $50 Million Commodity Account Gone,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Dec. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Highridge Futures Fund LP, a customer of the MF Global Inc. brokerage, said its $50 million account with the defunct company is ¡°missing.¡±
James Giddens, the trustee liquidating the brokerage, has ¡°failed and refused¡± to provide any information about the whereabouts of the account, Highridge said in a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Highridge asked the judge handling the case to order Giddens to locate and transfer the account, containing mostly cash and also unsettled commodity positions.
Highridge described itself in the filing as a registered commodity pool incorporated in Delaware, with a general partner that is an Illinois company.
Giddens has transferred about 38,000 commodity accounts to other firms, and said he plans to sell 330 securities accounts. Three transfers of collateral made and pending will give commodity customers about $4 billion of their assets, according to court filings.
¡°Highridge¡¯s account was not among the accounts transferred,¡± the fund said. ¡°This account is nowhere to be found.¡±
Kent Jarrell, a Giddens spokesman, said, ¡°The trustee¡¯s office has been in contact with Highridge and will continue to try to resolve the issue without the need for a judicial decision.¡±
Transfer Lists
Highridge said its account showed up twice on lists of accounts to be transferred to other future firms, first to Vision Financial Markets LLC, then to R.J. O¡¯Brien.
CME Clearing, part of CME Group Inc., told Highridge on Nov. 29 that there was no information on the account because its unsettled positions were on the London Metal Exchange, which also had no information to give at the time.
¡°Twice Highridge was told the account was being transferred and twice the account was not transferred,¡± it said.
Separately, Queen¡¯s Quay Avante Ltd., which opened a Canadian dollar account of $7 million at MF Global on Sept. 21, said it hadn¡¯t received any money from the all-cash account, possibly because of the Canadian currency, or a failed wire transfer from Harris Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago, which was maintaining the account, to ¡°a different bank.¡±
Account Shortfall
The shortfall in the MF Global brokerage¡¯s U.S. segregated customer accounts may exceed $1.2 billion, more than double what was previously expected, Giddens has said. That would mean customer accounts are missing about 22 percent of their total of $5.4 billion.
The parent company¡¯s Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing, the eighth-largest in U.S. history, listed assets of $41 billion. The firm said it has about $26 million in cash. Jon Corzine, the former co-chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., quit as MF Global¡¯s CEO on Nov. 4.
The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The parent¡¯s bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

It¡¯s a shot across the bow to President Vladimir Putin, who¡¯s faced growing pressure from inside and outside the government for new measures to pull the world¡¯s largest energy exporter out of its first recession in six years. While Russia has adjusted to the collapse in oil prices by allowing the ruble to lose almost half its value since January 2014 and letting consumer demand bear the brunt of the downturn, its economy remains hamstrung by corruption and inefficiencies.
Russia ranks alongside Nigeria and Kyrgyzstan at 136th, out of 174 countries, in Transparency International¡¯s 2014 ranking of perceived levels of corruption, down from 82 nd in 2000, a year after Putin came to power. Its property rights rank 120th and the level of judicial independence 109th of 144 nations in the World Economic Forum¡¯s latest Global Competitiveness Report.
Investment Crash
While compounded by U.S. and European sanctions and turmoil on commodities markets, the slump in Russian investment predates the standoff over Ukraine. It¡¯s now reached 20 months, the longest stretch of declines since at least 1995, when Bloomberg started compiling the figures. September data set to be released next week will show capital spending fell 7.3 percent from a year earlier, according to the median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
The central bank forecasts the economy won¡¯t return to annual growth until 2017, meaning Russia is on track for the longest recession in two decades. Gross domestic product will contract 3.9 percent to 4.4 percent this year and may shrink as much as 1 percent next year, according to a Bank of Russia forecast that projects oil staying at $50 in 2016-2018.
Putin¡¯s Backing
While Putin scolded the central bank last year for not reacting more quickly to the currency crisis, he¡¯s since rarely wavered in his support for Nabiullina, including her switch to a free-floating exchange rate last November. The policy shift was ¡°correct and timely¡± despite ¡°some negative consequences¡± for the economy and households, Putin said Tuesday at a conference organized by VTB Capital in Moscow.
The Bank of Russia said Wednesday that it won¡¯t ¡°artificially restrain the ruble rate,¡± responding to a report in the Financial Times that the government is discussing limits on how much the currency may strengthen against the dollar to ease the country¡¯s economic dependence on commodities.
What Russia needs is a growth model based on crude prices that ¡°aren¡¯t very high,¡± according to Nabiullina, a former economy minister in Putin¡¯s cabinet. The government, which relies on oil and gas for almost half of its revenue, is drafting next year¡¯s budget by assuming an average oil price of $50 a barrel.
¡°The main thing for us now is to learn to live under the conditions of relatively low prices for oil,¡± Nabiullina said. ¡°That¡¯s the reality for which we must be mentally ready. The financial sector is ready for the reality that forced an adjustment in the balance of payments. Now the economy is adjusting to this reality¡±

53,$50 Oil Kills Bonanza Dream Making Greenlanders Millionaires,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
(Bloomberg) -- Greenland, an island that may be sitting on trillions of dollars of oil, has had to acknowledge that its dream of tapping into that wealth looks increasingly far-fetched.
Back when oil was headed for $150 a barrel, Greenlanders girded for a production boom after inviting in some of the world¡¯s biggest explorers, including Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. Now, with Brent crude dipping below $50 last week, Deputy Prime Minister Andreas Uldum says Greenland¡¯s hope of growing rich quickly on fossil fuels was ¡°naÃ¯ve.¡±
¡°I myself believed back when I was first elected¡± to parliament in 2009 ¡°that billions from oil and minerals would start flowing to us the next year or the year after that,¡± he said in an interview in Copenhagen. ¡°However, that¡¯s just not the reality. I don¡¯t know any politician in Greenland today who won¡¯t admit to having fueled the hysteria.¡±
The nation of about 56,000 had imagined its oil and mineral production would turn every citizen into a millionaire. Instead, Greenland continues to rely on an annual 3.68 billion-krone ($586 million) subsidy from Denmark to stay afloat, a sum that¡¯s equivalent to almost half its gross domestic product. Talk of severing ties from its former colonial master has also faded as Greenlanders see little prospect of achieving economic independence anytime soon.
¡°Now we know what is realistic and what isn¡¯t, and we should not expect any revenue or pseudo-figure flowing into our budget from this and that,¡± Uldum said. ¡°That¡¯s simply not realistic. We¡¯ll conduct a responsible economic policy.¡±
Roaming Icebergs
Less than a decade ago, the combination of a hotter planet melting the ice around Greenland and a booming Chinese economy driving up commodities prices looked destined to turn the world¡¯s largest island into an Arctic El Dorado.
But none of the companies awarded licenses was able to make any commercial finds, even before the oil price dropped to a level that would make production unprofitable. And while global warming has melted some of the ice, the result has also been to make exploration more hazardous as icebergs the size of multi-story buildings break free from the island, threatening to sink any exploration vessels that might cross their path.
To be sure, the cycle is a familiar one. Explorers approached Greenland after the oil crises of the 1970s, only to abandon the place for three decades. In 2010, Cairn Energy Plc returned but didn¡¯t make any commercial finds after spending more than $1 billion during two years of drilling.
Something Big
The island¡¯s other commodities have also failed to lead to riches. A dramatic fall in iron ore prices and the Ebola epidemic sent London Mining Plc into reconstruction before the company had a chance to develop its $2 billion Isua iron-ore project north of Greenland¡¯s capital Nuuk.
The project may still go ahead after the mining rights were bought by China¡¯s General Nice Resources Ltd, according to Uldum. The arrival of a better capitalized company raises the prospects that Greenlanders one day may benefit from underground riches, he said.
¡°Whether we need to adapt projects to be sustainable even at lower prices I don¡¯t know,¡± Uldum said. ¡°I don¡¯t think we should get involved with how miners operate their mines.¡±
Meanwhile, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates there could be as much as 50 billion barrels of oil and gas beneath Greenland¡¯s waters, about double the amount left in the North Sea.
¡°There used to be a silhouette of something big getting drawn up for us -- oil and mineral prices were high,¡± Uldum said. ¡°But it was also a matter of the business conditions back then. They were shifted several times and that made people uncertain, and then you don¡¯t want to start up a business. That¡¯ll stop now. There¡¯s absolutely no reason for us to continue to make life difficult for ourselves.¡±

54,$52 Steaks on Menu as AT&T Feted Lawmakers During T-Mobile Push,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 2 (Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. feted lawmakers at Washington restaurants offering $52 steaks and a $15 ¡°Lobbyist¡¯s Libation¡± made of gin and cucumber puree as the company sought U.S. approval to buy T-Mobile USA Inc.
The parties, carrying $1,000 admission charges and aimed at replenishing congressional campaign coffers, were held as the largest U.S. phone company sought regulators¡¯ blessing for the $39 billion deal. On Aug. 31, the Justice Department sued to block the transaction, saying it would harm competition.
The litigation marks a rare setback for AT&T, long a leading Washington power. The Dallas-based company boosted lobbying spending by 30 percent to $11.7 million in the first six months of 2011 compared with a year earlier, Senate records show. AT&T¡¯s political action committee gave $805,500 to federal candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington research group.
¡°The one thing you can say about their losing is that it wasn¡¯t for a lack of lobbyists,¡± Bill Allison, editorial director of the Sunlight Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit that promotes government transparency, said in an interview. ¡°They left no stone unturned.¡±
AT&T supplemented its own in-house lobbyists with 18 outside firms pushing for the merger, Senate records show. The firm of former U.S. senators John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, and Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, received $240,000. A company headed by former U.S. Representative J.C. Watts, an Oklahoma Republican, got $100,000.
K Street
Former House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin¡¯s firm was paid $50,000, while Wiley Rein LLP, a law firm on Washington¡¯s K Street co-founded by former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Richard Wiley, received $160,000.
Clyburn Consulting LLC, where the principal is William Clyburn Jr., a cousin to Representative James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat, received $60,000. James Clyburn is father of Mignon Clyburn, one of three Democrats on the FCC. The agency is continuing its review of the merger.
William Clyburn hasn¡¯t contacted the commissioner about the AT&T merger, Dave Grimaldi, Mignon Clyburn¡¯s chief of staff, said in an interview. William Clyburn didn¡¯t return a telephone call seeking comment.
PAC Donations
AT&T¡¯s political action committee, which funnels employees¡¯ contributions to lawmakers¡¯ campaigns, was the most generous corporate PAC this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. Congress doesn¡¯t play a direct role in merger approval. Lawmakers may seek to influence the regulatory agencies.
House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over telecommunications policy, each received $5,000 from AT&T¡¯s PAC.
The head of AT&T¡¯s Washington office, Senior Executive Vice President Jim Cicconi, last year donated $1,500 to Boehner, $2,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and $1,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Giving by AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson since 2009 has included $2,000 to Boehner, $6,000 to the Republican senatorial committee and $4,000 to the Republican congressional committee, the center¡¯s records show.
AT&T¡¯s contributions this year have split 64 percent to Republicans and 36 percent to Democrats, compared with a breakdown of 55 percent Republican and 45 percent Democratic in the previous election cycle of 2009-2010.
Lobbyist¡¯s Libation
AT&T hosted at least nine fundraising receptions and dinners since the deal was announced on March 20, according to invitations collected by the Sunlight Foundation and posted on its website.
The Lobbyist¡¯s Libation cocktail is available at Charlie Palmer Steak, at the foot of Capitol Hill, where AT&T and one of its outside firms, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, shared hosting duties for a June 14 fundraising dinner for Representative Henry Waxman, of California, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee.
AT&T¡¯s PAC has given Waxman $4,000 so far this year, and Akin Gump¡¯s PAC gave him $1,200. Akin Gump received $240,000 this year to lobby on behalf of the merger and other issues.
BLT Steak, which touts its location in the same neighborhood as the White House, offers a $52 New York strip steak, oysters at $34 a dozen, and for $10 a dessert of lavender ice cream. It was the scene of a June 21 fundraising dinner hosted by AT&T for Representative Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican who sits on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Roskam received $3,500 from AT&T¡¯s PAC.
¡°Whenever you have an interest that¡¯s hiring a lot of lobbyists and pushing a public policy position, you¡¯re going to see them hosting a lot of fundraisers,¡± said Allison, of the Sunlight Foundation.

Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing's property developer, said profit climbed 53 percent last year because of higher earnings from real estate and at its Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. unit.
Net income rose to HK$27.7 billion ($3.6 billion), or HK$11.95 a share, from HK$18.08 billion, or HK$7.80, in 2006, the city's second-biggest builder by market value said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. That beats the HK$24.7 billion average of five analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Cheung Kong, which grew out of the plastics business Li founded more than 50 years ago, benefited in 2007 as a four-year economic boom and falling interest rates fueled gains in Hong Kong real estate prices. Profit was also helped by Hutchison Whampoa's sale of its business in India.
``Profit is still largely driven by growth in Hutchison,'' said Castor Pang, a strategist at Hong Kong-based Sun Hung Kai Financial & Co., before the release. ``There's a bit of uncertainty about its property business this year because of concerns over the movement of property prices in Hong Kong.''
The Hong Kong landlord for companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG said sales excluding jointly-developed property projects rose to HK$13.3 billion from HK$11 billion. Cheung Kong will pay a final dividend of HK$1.95 a share, up from HK$1.74 in 2006.
Profit excluding earnings from Cheung Kong's 49.97 percent stake in Hutchison Whampoa, Li's telecommunications company, rose 54 percent to HK$12.4 billion from HK$8.07 billion.
Shares of Cheung Kong, the worst performer last year in the six-member Hang Seng Property Index, rose 3.1 percent to HK$111.7 at the 12:30 p.m. trading break in Hong Kong, before earnings were announced. The stock has lost 23 percent this year, outpacing the 18 percent decline in the Hang Seng Index.
Li, 79, is ranked No. 11 on Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest people with a fortune of $26.5 billion, the publication said this month."
56,$6.5 Billion in Energy Writedowns and We're Just Getting Started,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
TheÂ oil and gas industry¡¯s earnings season is barely under way, and already there¡¯s been $6.5 billion in writedowns.
On Thursday, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. reported a $3.7 billion charge for the third quarter, while Southwestern Energy Co. -- which has a market value of $4.5 billion -- recorded $2.8 billion. And that¡¯s just the beginning. Barclays Plc estimated in an Oct. 21 analysis that there could be $20 billion in charges among just six companies. Southwestern¡¯s writedown was double Barclays¡¯ forecast.
""We also received many scars in the past tough times, and we¡¯ll have many more before the cycle is finished,"" said Steven Mueller, Southwestern chief executive officer, during a conference call with analysts on Friday.
Oil prices have tumbled 44 percent in the past year, and natural gas is down 35 percent, making the write-offs a foregone conclusion from an accounting standpoint. The companies use an accounting method that requires them to recognize a charge when estimates of future cash flow from their properties falls below what the companies spent buying and developing the acreage. The predictions of future cash flow have fallen along with prices.
Since it¡¯s no secret oil and gas prices have plunged, ¡°the majority of write-offs are typically non-events,¡± said Barclays¡¯ analysts led by Thomas R. Driscoll in the report.
Share Plunge
Southwestern¡¯s shares declined 5 percent today to $11.07, 67 percent lower than a year ago. Phoenix-based Freeport-McMoRan¡¯s are down 62 percent in the past 12 months.
Barclays predicted ceiling-test impairments for Apache Corp., Chesapeake Energy Corp., Devon Energy Corp., Encana Corp. and Newfield Exploration Co. All five companies are scheduled to report third-quarter results in November.
¡°Many companies will have writedowns as the price of oil is about half of where it once was and gas is also down,¡± said Timothy Parker, a Baltimore-based fund manager at T. Rowe Price Group Inc.. ¡°However, it won¡¯t generally hurt the companies because very few have debt covenants that are linked to book value, which the writedowns affect.¡±

Dec. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Former Argentine Economy Minister Felisa Miceli was sentenced to four years in prison for crimes related to the discovery of more than $64,000 in a paper bag in her office bathroom in 2007.
Miceli, 60, was also banned by a federal court from service in public office for eight years, according to a statement today on the official website of the country¡¯s justice system. The court found her guilty of a cover-up and of destroying official documents, according to the statement.

58,$64 Million Catfish Caper Lands Importer in Tank for 22 Months,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
July 27 (Bloomberg) -- A New Jersey seafood importer was sentenced to 22 months for fraudulently importing Vietnamese catfish and was ordered to pay $64 million in restitution for evading anti-dumping tariffs.
Thomas George, 61, founder and former chief executive officer of Sterling Seafood Corp. in Cresskill, New Jersey, also must make a $50,000 community service payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, U.S. District Judge Faith Hochberg ruled in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.
George admitted he bought more than $539,000 in Vietnamese catfish from a Virginia company and falsely resold it as grouper and sole. George lives in Old Tappan, New Jersey.
George pleaded guilty on Jan. 26 to using false purchase orders, manifests, bills of lading and other documents to disguise catfish bought from a Vietnamese company.
In January 2003, the U.S. imposed an anti-dumping tariff on all imports of Vietnamese catfish because it was being sold at significantly lower prices than the market rates, according to prosecutors.
George admitted he evaded the tariff from June 2004 to June 2006 through the importation of 5.28 million kilograms of a type of catfish known as Pangasius hypophthalmus.
The case is United States of America v. George, 10-cr-29, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark)."

60,Cold-War Law Blocks Doubling U.S. Trade With Russia Under WTO,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. risks losing out on a potential doubling of exports to Russia unless Congress repeals a Cold War-era law passed to punish the Communist Soviet Union.
The World Trade Organization¡¯s pending approval of Russia¡¯s membership may leave the U.S. unable to take advantage of a 22 percent reduction in tariffs that European and Asian nations will enjoy.
The obstacle is the Jackson-Vanik amendment, passed by Congress in 1974 to bar favorable trade relations with the Soviet Union because it wouldn¡¯t let Jewish citizens emigrate. Lawmakers such as Representatives Chris Smith and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen have questioned repealing the law and easing trade with Russia because of its human-rights and economic policies.
¡°Unless Congress passes a repeal, the U.S. business community is not on equal footing with European and Asian competitors,¡± Randi Levinas, executive vice president of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, with members such as Boeing Co., General Motors Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp., said in an interview. ¡°They won¡¯t get the same benefits when Russia joins.¡±
President Barack Obama has said he supports Russia¡¯s entry into the WTO, the international trade arbiter. Membership for the largest nation outside the 153-member group will be put to a vote at a meeting of trade ministers Dec. 16 in Geneva. Russia¡¯s Duma, the lower house of parliament, has until mid-June to ratify the accord, the final step before it takes effect. Maxim Medvedkov, Russia¡¯s chief WTO negotiator, said Nov. 10 in Geneva that Russian lawmakers will probably approve membership early next year.
More Open
U.S. exports to Russia may more than double in five years, to $19 billion from $9 billion in 2010, under WTO membership, according to a report last month from the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
More important is that WTO rules would require Russia to become a more open trading partner, with greater respect for intellectual property and more consistent food-safety regulations, according to Levinas. Such transparency may improve Russia¡¯s ranking at 120th of 183 nations in the World Bank¡¯s report on the ease of doing business.
The U.S. had a $19.7 billion trade deficit with Russia last year, according to the U.S. Trade Representative¡¯s office. Trade between the two nations has increased almost sevenfold since 1993, when the U.S. began granting annual waivers from the restrictions, according to a report by Bloomberg Government.
Russia exported more than $400 billion in goods last year, mainly to the European Union, Ukraine, Turkey, China and Belarus, according to the WTO. Imports were valued at almost $249 billion. Trade in services such as transportation and travel was $114 billion.
¡®Not Relevant¡¯
¡°Congress and the administration know full well Jackson-Vanik has to go,¡± Joshua Meltzer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington specializing in global economy and development, said in an interview. ¡°The issues that were around many, many years ago, they¡¯re not relevant at all.¡±
An impediment to Russia joining the WTO was removed last month when Russia and Georgia agreed on how to handle trade along their disputed border.
¡°Russia¡¯s membership in the WTO will lower tariffs, improve international access to Russia¡¯s services markets, hold the Russian government accountable to a system of rules governing trade behavior, and provide the means to enforce those rules,¡± Obama said in a Nov. 10 statement.
That view isn¡¯t universal in Congress, where some members, such as Smith, a New Jersey Republican, question whether Russia has done enough to warrant full trade benefits or sufficiently changed its ways since emerging as a nation after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
¡®Foolish Talk¡¯
¡°It¡¯s moving in the wrong direction,¡± Smith said in an interview. ¡°I¡¯m looking for a trend. I don¡¯t expect it to have arrived, but expect it to be on the right path.¡±
Smith said he¡¯s undecided on repealing Jackson-Vanik and that the administration hasn¡¯t prodded Russia enough toward democracy, religious freedom and free speech due to what Obama has called his ¡°reset¡± in relations between the nations.
¡°There was foolish talk about ¡®resetting,¡¯¡± Smith, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said. ¡°Reset what? What does it mean?¡±
The House Ways and Means Committee hasn¡¯t scheduled action on repealing Jackson-Vanik, according to Jim Billimoria, the panel¡¯s spokesman.
¡°I¡¯m not ready to do anything on Jackson-Vanik,¡± Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a Nov. 16 interview. Once the U.S. normalizes relations with Russia, it would have little leverage to press for improvement in human rights or movement toward greater democracy, Ros-Lehtinen said.
Election Protests
Tens of thousands of people gathered in more than 30 Russian cities on Dec. 10 to protest fraud in parliamentary elections. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the continent¡¯s democracy watchdog, the U.S., Germany and the EU criticized violations during the Dec. 4 vote.
The leaders of the Judiciary committees in the U.S. House and Senate have ¡°significant concerns¡± about whether Russia will respect U.S. intellectual-property rights, according to a Nov. 9 letter signed by the senior Democrats and Republicans on the panels.
With Jackson-Vanik still in place, Russia would have the discretion to keeps tariffs higher in trade with the U.S. than the WTO provides for other members, according to Howard Rosen, a fellow at the Peterson Institute. In addition, the U.S. wouldn¡¯t benefit from the intellectual-property protection and adoption of food safety regulations, he said.
¡®Move Forward¡¯
¡°The question would be best posed to Russia,¡± Rosen said in an interview. ¡°Would they be willing to move forward if it is not removed?¡±
Representatives at the Russian embassy in Washington didn¡¯t return messages seeking comment.
Under the terms of its WTO agreement, Russia would gradually cut its average tariff ceiling with the U.S. for manufactured goods to 7.3 percent from 9.5 percent currently. Duties on farm products would drop to 10.8 percent from 13.2 percent. On average, the tariff cap on Russian goods would fall to 7.8 percent from 10 percent now, a 22 percent cut.
Tariffs on dairy products would fall to 14.9 percent from 19.8 percent, automobiles would be cut to 12 percent from 15.5 percent and tariffs on cereals would decline to 10 percent from 15.1 percent.
Beef, Pork, Poultry
Foreign beef, pork and poultry entering Russia¡¯s market would face lower tariffs while higher duties would be applied to products exceeding quotas, under the WTO agreement. The longest period for implementation is eight years for poultry, followed by seven years for cars, helicopters and civil aircraft.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business association, will lobby lawmakers to repeal the trade barrier, according to Christopher Wenk, senior director for international policy for the Washington-based group.
¡°The business community will be talking about commercial benefits, the economic benefits of having Russia in the WTO,¡± Wenk said in an interview. ¡°It¡¯s only good to have them under the tent playing by the same rules as the WTO.¡±
Ultimately, fate of the Jackson-Vanik restrictions that were crafted by Senator Henry ¡°Scoop¡± Jackson, a Washington Democrat, may depend on the stand taken by House Speaker John Boehner. In a speech on Oct. 25, before Russia reached agreement with its neighbor, the Ohio Republican expressed concern for Georgia¡¯s ¡°territorial integrity.¡± The two former Soviet states fought a five-day war in 2008.
Boehner also cited ¡°significant outstanding commercial issues that must be addressed,¡± without elaboration. Michael Steel, a Boehner spokesman, didn¡¯t respond to inquiries about the speaker¡¯s intentions on Jackson-Vanik.

62,"$822,000 Worker Shows California Leads U.S. Pay Giveaway","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Dec. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Nine years ago, California Democrat Gray Davis became the first U.S. governor in 82 years to be recalled by voters. The state¡¯s 20 million taxpayers still bear the cost of his four years and 10 months on the job.
Davis escalated salaries and benefits for 164,000 state workers, including a 34 percent raise for prison guards, the first of a series of steps in which he and successors saddled California with a legacy of dysfunction. Today, the state¡¯s highest-paid employees make far more than comparable workers elsewhere in almost all job and wage categories, from public safety to health care, base pay to overtime.
Payroll data compiled by Bloomberg on 1.4 million public employees in the 12 most populous states show that California has set a pattern of lax management, inefficient operations and out-of-control costs. From coast to coast, states are cutting funding for schools, public safety and the poor as they struggle with fallout left by politicians who made pay-and-pension promises that taxpayers couldn¡¯t afford.
¡°It was completely avoidable,¡± said David Crane, a public-policy lecturer at Stanford University.
¡°All it took was for political leaders to think more about the general population and the future, rather than their political futures,¡± said Crane, a Democrat who worked as an economic adviser to former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. ¡°Citizens should be mad as hell, and they shouldn¡¯t take it anymore.¡±
Billions Short
Across the U.S., such compensation policies have contributed to state budget shortfalls of $500 billion in the past four years and prompted some governors, including Republican Scott Walker of Wisconsin, to strip most government employees of collective-bargaining rights and take other steps to limit payroll spending.
In California, Governor Jerry Brown hasn¡¯t curbed overtime expenses that lead the 12 largest states or limited payments for accumulated vacation time that allowed one employee to collect $609,000 at retirement in 2011. The 74-year-old Democrat has continued requiring workers to take an unpaid day off each month, which could burden the state with new costs in the future.
Last year, Brown waived a cap on accrued leave for prison guards while granting them additional paid days off. California¡¯s liability for the unused leave of its state workers has more than doubled in eight years, to $3.9 billion in 2011, from $1.4 billion in 2003, according to the state¡¯s annual financial reports.
¡®It¡¯s Outrageous¡¯
¡°It¡¯s outrageous what public employees in California receive in compensation and benefits,¡± said Lanny Ebenstein, who heads the California Center for Public Policy, a Santa Barbara-based research institution critical of public payrolls.
¡°Until public employee compensation and benefits are brought in line, there will be no answer to the fiscal shortfalls that California governments at every level face,¡± he said.
Among the largest states, almost every category of worker has participated in the pay bonanza. Britt Harris, chief investment officer at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, last year collected $1 million -- including his $480,000 salary and two years of bonuses -- more than four times what Republican Governor Rick Perry received. Pension managers in Ohio and Virginia made up to $678,000 and $660,000, respectively, according to the data, which Bloomberg obtained using public-record requests. In an interview, Harris said public pension pay must be competitive with the private sector to attract top investment talent.
Psychiatrists Lead
Psychiatrists were among the highest-paid employees in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and New Jersey, with total compensation $270,000 to $327,000 for top earners. State police officers in Pennsylvania collected checks as big as $190,000 for unused vacation and personal leave as they retired young enough to start second careers, while Virginia paid active officers as much as $109,000 in overtime alone, the data show.
The numbers are even larger in California, where a state psychiatrist was paid $822,000, a highway patrol officer collected $484,000 in pay and pension benefits and 17 employees got checks of more than $200,000 for unused vacation and leave. The best-paid staff in other states earned far less for the same work, according to the data.
Rising employee expenses are crowding out other priorities for state and local governments and draining resources for college tuition, health care, public safety, schools and other services, Schwarzenegger said in an e-mailed response to questions.
Salaries, Retirement
¡°California spends most of its money on salaries, retirement payments, health care benefits for government workers, and other compensation,¡± said Schwarzenegger, 65, who replaced Davis as governor. ¡°State revenues are up more than 50 percent over the past 10 years, but still we¡¯ve had to cut spending on services because so much of that revenue increase went to increases in compensation and benefits.¡±
Brown, who granted state workers collective-bargaining rights during his first tenure as governor more than three decades ago, has reduced pension costs for new employees while leaving most retirement benefits for current workers intact.
Last year, to balance the budget, he used a policy set by Schwarzenegger, his predecessor, to save $400 million through the forced monthly day off. He persuaded voters to back a tax increase, imposed a hiring freeze as his predecessors did and told as many as 26,000 prison employees they might lose their jobs as thousands of criminals are shifted to county jails.
Inherited Problems
¡°Governor Brown is busy fixing the many problems that he inherited from past administrations,¡± said Gareth Lacy, a spokesman for the governor. ¡°California¡¯s $26 billion budget deficit, and the decades-old structural imbalance, was eliminated in large part by cutting waste and slashing costs. The governor also achieved historic reforms to public pensions and workers¡¯ compensation that will save the state billions of dollars.¡±
Former governor Davis, in a telephone interview, said he now thinks state employee compensation is too high.
¡°I find it offensive that people who work for the state try to turn around and abuse the state through inflated overtime claims and lump-sum payouts,¡± Davis said. ¡°We have high salaries, they have to come down. There was a time when we could afford them, but we can¡¯t now.¡±
Brown, who took office in January 2011, had plenty of incentive to crack down. The per-worker costs of delivering services in California vastly exceed those even in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Ohio, where unions have the same right to bargain collectively for the best pay packages, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Sinking Schools
The result isn¡¯t only a heavier burden on California taxpayers. As higher expenses competed for fewer dollars, per-pupil funding of the state¡¯s public schools dropped to 35th nationally in 2009-2010 from 22nd in 2001-2002. Californians have endured recurring budget deficits throughout the past decade and now face the country¡¯s highest debt and Standard & Poor¡¯s lowest credit rating for a U.S. state.
The story of one prison psychiatrist shows how pay largesse has spread.
Mohammad Safi, graduate of a medical school in Afghanistan, collected $822,302 last year, up from $90,682 when he started in 2006, the data show. Safi was placed on administrative leave in July and is under investigation by the Department of State Hospitals, formerly the Department of Mental Health.
Long Hours
The doctor was paid for an average of almost 17 hours each day, including on-call time and Saturdays and Sundays, although he did take time off, said David O¡¯Brien, a spokesman for the department. In a brief interview outside his home in Newark, California, Safi said he¡¯d been placed on leave for working too many hours and declined to comment further. An increase in the number of beds at the facility where Safi worked forced him to cover more shifts, and he was allowed to do some of the work from home, said his lawyer, Ed Caden.
Safi and other psychiatrists employed by the state benefited from what amounted to a 2007 bidding war between California¡¯s prisons and mental health departments, after a series of federal court orders forced the state to improve its inmate care. Higher pay in the prison system was matched by mental health, and as psychiatrists followed larger salaries, the state¡¯s cost to provide the care soared.
Last year, 16 psychiatrists on California¡¯s payroll, including Safi, made more than $400,000. Only one did in any other state in the data compiled by Bloomberg, a doctor in Texas. Safi earned more than twice as much as any state psychiatrist elsewhere, the data show.
Accumulated Vacation
The disparity with other states is also evident in payments for accumulated vacation time when employees leave public service. No other state covered by the data compiled by Bloomberg paid a worker more than $200,000 for accrued leave last year, while 17 people got such payments in California. There were 240 employees who received at least $100,000 in California, compared with 42 in the other 11 states, the data show. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie calls such payments ¡°boat checks¡± because they can be large enough to buy a yacht.
Topping the list was $608,821 paid to psychiatrist Gertrudis Agcaoili, 79, who retired last year from the Napa state mental hospital after a 30-year career. Agcaoili said in a telephone interview that it was her right to take the payment.
¡®Against Rules¡¯
¡°Those payouts are payouts of accumulated salary that it¡¯s against the rules to allow people to accumulate, and it shouldn¡¯t have been done, and shouldn¡¯t be done,¡± said Marty Morgenstern, California¡¯s labor secretary, who served as state personnel director under Davis. ¡°They didn¡¯t accumulate that kind of leave time in one year. It¡¯s something that went on and on.¡±
Lacy, the governor¡¯s spokesman, said hiring freezes and furloughs, or the unpaid time Schwarzenegger forced employees to take, combined to inflate accruals of vacation and leave. Lacy said the expiration of Brown¡¯s version of the furloughs at the end of June will help reduce the balances.
Employees are told they must take unpaid furlough days before using paid vacation. That has boosted the backlog of unused leave, especially at agencies with round-the-clock operations.
Other states have taken steps to limit vacation payouts. New Jersey caps checks for departing state employees at $15,000, and New York limits payment of accrued time to 30 vacation days. Most New York employees may accrue 200 sick days, which can be used to offset retiree health-care premiums.
Overtime Millions
California also leads in overtime expenses, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Last year, it paid $964 million in overtime to 110,000 workers, an average of $8,741 per employee. That was more than twice the $415 million New York paid in overtime to 80,000 staff members, for an average of $5,199, and almost as much as all the other states in the database combined. In Georgia, total overtime for 8,935 workers last year was $12.3 million, an average $1,378.
California employees generally make at least 1.5 times their regular pay to work overtime. The state¡¯s overtime costs show mismanagement by the officials who run state departments, said former Georgia Governor Roy E. Barnes, a Democrat.
¡°Government is no different from business; you have to have good leaders,¡± Barnes said in a telephone interview. ¡°When you have somebody having that amount of overtime, then there¡¯s not good management control, there¡¯s not good leadership.¡±
Highway Patrol
The California Highway Patrol, whose brown-and-tan uniforms and weekly adventures in the 1970s and 1980s lit up television screens in the series ¡°CHiPs,¡± also boasts leading pay and benefits.
The best-paid among the patrol¡¯s sworn and uniformed employees make far more than those in other states, with overtime and lump-sum payouts that enlarge earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Former division chief Jeff Talbott retired last year from the California Highway Patrol as the best-paid trooper in the 12 largest U.S. states, with $483,581 in salary, pension and other compensation. Talbott declined a request to be interviewed.
While California¡¯s cost of living and relatively high private-sector pay account for some of the disparities in public payrolls, special circumstances in the Golden State combined to drive wages and benefits to levels far beyond other states, data show.
¡®Arduous Duty¡¯
Unions pressed for every perk they could squeeze out of governors and their department managers -- including ¡°arduous-duty¡± pay for office workers and special bonuses for call-center employees ¡°in recognition of the complex workload and level and knowledge required to receive and respond to consumer calls,¡± state documents show.
Most public employees aren¡¯t overpaid, and differences in compensation can be tied to regional labor markets, whether some states prefer delivering services at the local level and whether they have adequate staffing, said Steven Kreisberg, director of collective bargaining for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
¡°I don¡¯t think there¡¯s this kind of huge disparity as if somehow they¡¯re being overpaid and taking advantage of the systems,¡± Kreisberg said in a telephone interview from Washington. ¡°This is earned money.¡±
California has one of the leanest public workforces in the country in terms of the number of state employees per resident, said Lacy, Brown¡¯s spokesman. Measuring the payroll of its state workers per capita, excluding university employees, California ranks third-highest among the 12 largest states, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and the U.S. Census Bureau.
The California payroll totals reflected in the Bloomberg data have their roots in wage negotiations carried out during Davis¡¯s time as governor.
Pension Limits
One of the first goals of state employee unions when Davis took over in 1999 after 16 years of Republican governors was to unwind curbs on pensions put in place by Governor Pete Wilson in 1991. Workers also wanted broad wage increases.
Unions persuaded the California Public Employees¡¯ Retirement System to sponsor legislation called Senate Bill 400, which sweetened state and local pensions and gave retroactive increases for tens of thousands of retirees. Highway-patrol officers were granted the right to retire after 30 years of service with 90 percent of their top salaries, a benefit that was copied by police agencies across the state.
California¡¯s annual payment toward pension obligations ballooned to $3.7 billion in the current fiscal year from $300 million when the bill was enacted. Some cities that adopted the highway-patrol pension plan later cited those costs for contributing to their bankruptcy filings.
Pay Increases
Davis and the Legislature also agreed to labor contracts that gave 164,000 state workers pay increases of 4 percent in 1999 and again in 2000. Those contracts cost the state an extra $1.3 billion within a year, according to the state¡¯s independent Legislative Analyst¡¯s Office.
There were more to come.
After technology stocks plummeted in 2000, cutting tax revenue, Davis asked state workers to postpone additional raises.
In lieu of immediate increases, Davis and the California Legislature agreed to link highway patrol pay to an average of the five biggest law enforcement agencies in the state. The result: escalating raises that came due after Davis left office. Officers¡¯ pay rose 2.7 percent in fiscal 2004, 12.1 percent in fiscal 2005 and 5.6 percent and 5.7 percent in the following years, according the Legislative Analyst¡¯s Office.
Aiding Recruitment
The pay boosts were needed to help bring more officers to the agency at a time it couldn¡¯t fill all its cadet positions, said Jon Hamm, chief executive officer of the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, the union for CHP officers.
¡°At the time we accomplished our biggest gains, I actually felt I was losing the recruitment war,¡± Hamm said in an e-mailed statement. ¡°I think it is clear that when our biggest gains were negotiated I did not feel they were ¡®excessive;¡¯ in fact, almost the opposite was true.¡±
The wage increases help explain disparities in the data compiled by Bloomberg in which many California highway patrol officers now earn much more than counterparts in other states. For example, 45 California officers earned at least $200,000 in 2011, compared with nine in other states -- five in Pennsylvania and four in Illinois, according to the data. While more than 5,000 California troopers made $100,000 or more in 2011, only three in North Carolina did, the data show.
Guards Follow
The pay deal for the California Highway Patrol got the attention of the state¡¯s politically potent prison guards¡¯ union, which successfully lobbied to have its compensation tied to that of state troopers.
The result was a pay increase of more than 30 percent for members of the union over the five-year contract. The state¡¯s auditor, Elaine Howle, in July 2002 estimated the contract cost taxpayers an extra $500 million a year.
The prison guards¡¯ union gave Davis more than $3 million for his various elections, including $250,000 a few weeks after the pay increase was negotiated, campaign records show.
California had almost 11,000 workers in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation who made $100,000 or more in 2011, and about 900 prison employees earning more than $200,000 a year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. New York had none. Its top-paid officer is a sergeant at Sing Sing Correctional Facility who made $170,000 last year.
Deficit Balloons
Davis had taken office in 1999 with a $12 billion budget surplus. Four years later, he began his second term by reporting a $35 billion budget deficit -- about $1,000 for every man, woman and child in the state.
Davis was recalled in October 2003 amid criticism of the deficit, his handling of an energy crisis that saw power prices soar and political contributions from public-employee unions, technology companies and others.
After Davis left, lawsuits over the quality of care for prison inmates and patients of state mental-health hospitals rapidly elevated pay for doctors, dentists, nurses and psychiatrists.
In 2005 and the years that followed, a federal court took over prison health care and took steps that included reducing the time inmates had to wait for treatment.
That, combined with a crowded prison population, increased the workload and demand for nurses even as a shortage nationwide left the state with vacancies.
Union Rules
Union-negotiated rules required state departments to handle the extra work by offering overtime to California nurses before bringing in contract nurses from private companies. The requirement led to a greater reliance on overtime for nursing in California than in any other state, one that persists to this day.
Nurses in California last year made $673 million in total pay, including $103 million in overtime, or 15.3 percent. By contrast, those in New York made $561 million in total pay, of which almost $40 million was in overtime, or 7.1 percent.
Forty-two nurses in California¡¯s prisons and mental hospitals have reaped especially rich overtime payouts. They made an average of $1.3 million each during the seven years, including $674,000 in overtime.
The highest-paid nurse in the seven years was Lina Manglicmot, who worked at a state prison in Soledad, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) south of San Francisco. She collected $1.7 million from 2005 through 2011, including $1 million in overtime, the data show. Manglicmot declined to comment.
Wage Concessions
Curbing the compensation of California employees eluded Schwarzenegger through two terms as he tried to pry wage concessions back from their unions.
In 2009, he responded to a growing financial crisis by imposing furloughs, or a mandatory unpaid day off each month, for all state workers. The forced time off later grew to three days a month.
Furloughs depressed regular wages while increasing overtime compensation for employees, such as prison guards, who had to work through them. The first six months of the furloughs, for instance, cost California $52 million in accrued vacation time for prison guards alone, according to findings by the state Senate Office of Oversight and Outcomes.
The furloughs led to backlogs of vacation time for other state workers as well, in violation of state rules. California stipulates that workers shouldn¡¯t accumulate more than 640 hours of vacation or personal leave.
Forced Furloughs
¡°Furloughs were never meant to solve the state¡¯s structural budget problem or save money in the long run,¡± Schwarzenegger said. ¡°We had to do what was necessary to keep paying the bills and keep the lights on.¡±
More than 111,000 government employees working for the 12 most populous states collected $710 million in leave payouts last year, the data show. California workers accounted for almost 40 percent and have collected about $1.4 billion since 2005. The payouts have more than doubled in California in the past seven years.
¡°Those kinds of payments, they are absolutely inappropriate and we are doing everything we can to make sure it doesn¡¯t recur,¡± said Morgenstern, the state¡¯s labor secretary.
Public employee unions have made some concessions at the bargaining table, such as contributing as much as 5 percent more of their earnings toward pensions, and forgoing overtime pay for some holidays. State worker furloughs under Schwarzenegger amounted to a 15 percent pay cut; under Brown, they¡¯ve been about 5 percent.
Yet the legacy of California¡¯s collective bargaining, budget battles and court struggles over inmate care continue to elevate its payroll, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Allowing that to happen was a mistake, and taxpayers will be dealing with it for years, said Bob Stern, president of the nonpartisan Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles.
¡°The labor unions really called in their chits, and Davis went along with it,¡± Stern said by telephone. ¡°In hindsight, they should not have done it, because they made future generations pay for the benefits they approved.¡±

63,$83 Billion in South Africa Spending Fails to Keep Lights On,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
South Africans suffering through their country¡¯s longest run of power outages ever can draw little comfort from how much the government has spent on infrastructure in the past five years: One trillion rand ($83 billion).
That¡¯s bought improved roads, airports, ports and rail lines. What it hasn¡¯t produced: a reliable electricity supply. Rolling power blackouts have hit on average every third day this year. The National Treasury says ¡°low and unreliable levels of electricity¡± are the biggest obstacle to faster growth. Data released Tuesday showed factory output grew 3.8 percent in March, the first expansion this year after the fewest power cuts in any month since October.
South Africa accounts for almost a quarter of the 257 infrastructure projects of $50 million or more being developed in Africa and half of the 10 biggest, said a study released by Deloitte LLP in March. Yet the power constraints negate the advantage of improved transport links that should be boosting company sales and exports.
¡°The numbers are big but the effectiveness of the infrastructure spending has been very, very poor,¡± Dennis Dykes, chief economist at Nedbank Group Ltd., South Africa¡¯s fourth-largest lender, said by phone on May 4. ¡°Thus far, we have got no return at all from a number of capital projects. We have got a major problem¡± with the power supply, he said.
The energy shortfall arose after the government stalled the approval of new power plants, leaving Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which supplies about 95 percent of the nation¡¯s electricity, with a plethora of malfunctioning plants.
Coal Plants
The economy could have been 10 percent larger had it not been for the power shortages, according to Dawie Roodt, chief economist at Pretoria-based advisory service Efficient Group Ltd. Twenty-one years after the end of apartheid, a lack of jobs keeps 10.9 million South Africans, or 22 percent of the population, below the poverty line of 322 rand a month. A quarter of the work force is jobless.
Two new coal-fired plants being built by Eskom, the first since the 1980s, are running four years behind schedule due to technical failures and strikes. The plants, known as Medupi and Kusile, are expected to cost about 38 percent more than what was estimated in 2007.
The government should shoulder part of the blame for the infrastructure deficiencies, said Andre Pottas, southern African head of infrastructure and capital projects at Deloitte.
¡°We are short of engineering skills,¡± he said by phone from Durban. ¡°The procurement processes are very complex. We see a lot of stop-start on projects.¡±
Energy Crisis
The Geneva-based World Economic Forum¡¯s 2014-2015 Global Competitiveness Report ranks the reliability of South Africa¡¯s electricity supply 99th out of 144 countries. The quality of transport infrastructure, by contrast, is 32nd.
The government has acknowledged its shortcomings: On April 15 Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown apologized to the country for the power shortages.
On April 17, the government appointed Transnet SOC Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Brian Molefe as acting CEO of Eskom and directed him to resolve the energy crisis. It¡¯s also contracted with private companies to supply 5,243 megawatts of renewable energy to the national grid, and plans to buy 2,500 megawatts of power generated from coal and 3,126 megawatts from gas.
Rolling Blackouts
Transnet is an example of a state business that¡¯s making progress on infrastructure investment. The logistics company is in the third year of a seven-year, 312.2-billion-rand plan to upgrade railways, ports and fuel pipelines. It¡¯s moving record volumes of coal, manganese and freight via rail, and 60 trains now run daily between Johannesburg and the east coast city of Durban, up from 20 a decade ago.
State-owned Eskom is spending 280 billion rand on more than 8,000 projects over five years to increase its generation, distribution and transmission capacity.
Molefe aims to use the experience he gained during his four years heading Transnet to end the blackouts by year-end by sourcing another 3,000 megawatts of electricity and boosting maintenance. He expects power shortages to ease within three to four years as the utility tackles a maintenance backlog and new plants come online.
¡°There is steady but sure progress that is being made,¡± he said in an April 22 interview in Cape Town.
Direct Jobs
The government and state companies plan to spend a further 813 billion rand on infrastructure over the three years through March 2018, with 62 percent of the funds allocated to energy and transport projects.
A committee headed by President Jacob Zuma was set up in 2012 to coordinate 18 integrated developments and address bottlenecks. Projects overseen by the panel, which range from new power plants, dams and pipelines to improving broadband Internet access, sustain more than 220,000 direct jobs and are already having a positive impact on the economy, the presidency said in an April 30 e-mail.
The Treasury forecasts that growth will be limited to 2 percent this year because of the power shortages, up from 1.5 percent in 2014 when strikes stifled mine and factory output. The government is targeting 5 percent growth by 2019 as it seeks to reduce the unemployment rate to 14 percent.
¡°We will be in much better position by the time we get to 2020,¡± Nedbank¡¯s Dykes said. ¡°There is absolutely no intrinsic reason why South Africa can¡¯t grow much faster.¡±
The interventions to address the electricity shortfall have been too little, too late, said Gareth Ackerman, chairman of Cape Town-based retailer Pick n Pay Stores Ltd., which has installed backup generators to run its fridges and tills, a solution unaffordable for some smaller companies.
¡°This is damaging small business and damaging the economy as a whole,¡± he said. ¡°We need to find ways of getting that fixed quickly and the government needs to find solutions.¡±"
64,$89 Million-A-Year Stock Picker's a Bull on Adult Diapers,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
In case you missed it, the Wall Street Journal has an interesting profile out today on Mario Gabelli, the $89 million-a-year founder of Gamco Investors Inc.Â  The story details 73-year-old Gabelli's success over the years as a stock-picker and his steadfast commitment to a research-heavy process even as a growing portion of the investing public is throwing in the towel on stock-picking in favor of index investing. Yet there was one juicy tidbit that came and went without much elaboration and, well, let's see if you can find what it is: ""Mr. Gabelli, who is thin with white hair, spends much of his free time immersing himself in myriad subjects from quarry mines to adult diapers, which he considers a growing market because of the aging population."" Wall Street's highest-paid CEOÂ is bullish on adult diapers! This is an investment theme that could spawn so many think pieces, like ... well, let's not go there (the jokes would be too cheap and easy.) Instead let's take a look atÂ why diapers, both the adult and baby varieties, may smell like roses to investors like Gabelli. (OK, sorry for that one cheap joke.) For one thing, it's not just the huge demographic of Baby Boomers who are following Gabelli into the white-haired years. It's also in emerging markets, where the runway for growth is much larger than the U.S., where the disposable baby-diaper market is saturated. (Sorry again. These cheap jokes can be hard to resist!) Â  Â  Sales of diapers in China and Eastern Europe rose 30 percent in the most recent quarter at Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies for babies and Depends for their grandparents. Â And get this -- while many multinational corporations like Kimberly-Clark are struggling with the strong dollar's effect on sales, this growth was driven by price increases meant to combat weakening overseas currencies. While diapers may indeed contain elastic, demand for diapers seems to be reasonably inelastic.Â  Gabelli's diaper play, however, is a more concentrated and bold bet. AndÂ frankly, it's been a real stinker of late. (OK, hopefully that's the last diaper joke.) Gamco has amassed a 16 percent stakeÂ in the small-cap Tredegar Corp., which makes the plastic films used in diapers. Â Â 
At first it worked out great: GabelliÂ took an initial stake of about 6.9 percent in 1994, and the stock jumped more than 800 percent by April 1999.Â The shares crashed hard, however, and never quite reclaimed that peak. The stock is down more than 50 percent from its most recent highÂ in 2013 as the company's plastic-film business struggled with problems at a plant in Brazil and delays in the startup of a new product line.Â 
As for Gabelli, this roughly $77 million position may not seem like much compared with the $47 billion Gamco manages or, heck, even the $89 million that Mario reportedly made last year. Yet it's clear this position is one that's close to Gabelli's heart. While Tredegar's conference calls are usually a short affair since not many analysts cover the stock, Mario himself has been known to make an appearance. Â  ""Hi, Mario. How are you doing?"" former CEO Nancy Taylor asked on the earnings call in March. ""Not too bad,"" Gabelli replied. ""I missed part of the call, because there are too many conference calls, but always wanted to listen to yours,"" he said before asking how the company was marking certain assets to market. Â 
This morning, TredegarÂ announced that its interim CEO will take over the top job permanently and the president of its film products business will leave the company. Â The stock promptly fell and is trading at a three-year low.Â 
Being a diaper bull can be a messy affair. (Sorry.) Â "
65,China Permits First IPO Since September; Brokers Gain,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 19 (Bloomberg) -- China approved its first initial public offering since September, triggering gains in brokerage shares on speculation the ending of the 10-month moratorium will spur fee income and trading.
Citic Securities Co., China¡¯s largest brokerage by market value, and second-ranked Haitong Securities Co. advanced in Shanghai trading after Guilin Sanjin Pharmaceutical Co. said its IPO will go ahead.
The Shanghai Composite Index has jumped 58 percent this year, reassuring regulators that the market can withstand the increased supply of stock. The China Securities Regulatory Commission stopped allowing public offerings in September after the stock market had plunged 60 percent since the start of 2008.
¡°Brokerages¡¯ earnings will be boosted by the IPO resumption,¡± said Leo Gao, who helps manage the equivalent of $1 billion at APS Asset Management Ltd. in Shanghai. ¡°They can get more fees and generate new deals.¡±
Citic rose 2.8 percent to 29.54 yuan at the close on the Shanghai stock exchange. Haitong, which has more than doubled this year, climbed 1.8 percent to 17.14 yuan. Sinolink Securities Co. surged by the 10 percent daily limit and Hong Yuan Securities Co. gained 3.8 percent. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.9 percent.
Testing Market
Regulators plan to let smaller companies go public first to test the market¡¯s readiness for share sales, people familiar with the situation said on June 18.
Sanjin, China¡¯s biggest producer of herbal lozenges, aims to raise about 634 million yuan ($93 million). The company will start a roadshow and seek a price for the sale on June 22, it said in a statement late yesterday.
Zhejiang Wanma Cable Co. and Shenzhen Salubris Pharmaceuticals Co. are also likely to get final IPO approval soon, the people said. The companies each plan to raise less than 650 million yuan, according to documents they¡¯ve filed with the regulator.
¡°Brokerages are direct beneficiaries of the resumption of new share sales, which will bring an additional revenue source,¡± said Wang Zheng, a fund manager at Jingxi Investment Management Co. in Shanghai.
China¡¯s stocks rebounded this year after the government implemented a 4 trillion-yuan stimulus plan, prompting a surge in lending and investment. The World Bank yesterday upgraded its economic growth forecast for China to 7.2 percent this year, from 6.5 percent estimated in March.
Investor Confidence
Initial public offerings in Hong Kong and China may raise a combined $39 billion this year as investor confidence recovers and regulators ease rules, accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP projected today.
First-time public stock offerings in Hong Kong may fetch HK$145 billion ($18.7 billion), according to Loletta Chow, the accounting firm¡¯s assurance leader in Hong Kong and China South. IPO funds raised on the mainland stock market could hit 137 billion yuan ($20 billion).
Thirty-two companies have been given approval to raise money by tapping equity markets without receiving a date for their listings. Those sales may collect a combined 70 billion yuan, according to Guotai Junan Securities Co.
The resumption of public offerings will bolster revenue at investment banks authorized to underwrite local equity sales. Chinese firms sold a record 472 billion yuan of stock in 2007, second only to U.S. sales, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The offerings generated 7.97 billion yuan in fees.
Exports Slumped
The Shanghai Composite jumped 97 percent in 2007 before tumbling last year as exports slumped in the global recession. China¡¯s economy, the world¡¯s third largest, grew 6.1 percent in the first quarter of 2009, the weakest pace in a decade.
Sanjin shares will be offered to institutional investors and retail investors on June 29, the company said in the statement. Companies can issue a statement for roadshows after they obtain written approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
Sanjin passed a hearing before the CSRC¡¯s listing panel a year ago, the penultimate step in the process of gaining final IPO approval.
Wanma Cable, a producer of electric cable based in Eastern Zhejiang, passed its listing hearing on June 30 last year, and aims to raise 343 million yuan. Salubris received the listing panel¡¯s go-ahead on Sept. 3, targeting a 521 million yuan offering. All three companies plan to sell stock in Shenzhen.
China Merchants Securities Co. is arranging the IPOs of Sanjin and Salubris. Ping An Securities Co. is managing Wanma Cable¡¯s sale.

66,$90 Billion Fund Pledges Support as Denmark Resumes Debt Sales,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
As Denmark returns to the debt markets it abandoned in January, the country¡¯s biggest commercial pension fund is promising to be there to help pick up the pieces.
PFA Pension, which oversees about $90 billion in assets, says it¡¯s intending to brave the uncertainty that will accompany the Danish government¡¯s first bond sale in more than eight months.
The fund, which heldÂ about $14 billion in the debt at the beginning of the year, ¡°will remain a faithful investor,¡± Chief Investment Officer Christian Lage said in a phone interview.
Bond issuance has been suspended since January
Here¡¯s a brief recap of what happened in January:
Switzerland¡¯s decision to send the franc into a free float triggered speculation Denmark would do the same and abandon its euro peg The Danish central bank responded over the following weeks by cutting its deposit rate to minus 0.75 percent and building up record foreign currency reserves The Danes then applied their own version of quantitative easing, suspending bond issuance to cut supply and drive down long yields, all in an effort to keep speculators out
The result was a plunge in Danish government bond volumes that arrived just as global investors started to panic about liquidity.
Adding to pressure on the debt office is Denmark¡¯s announcement last month that it will need to borrow about 6 percent more from markets than it had previously estimated. It¡¯s against that backdrop that institutional investors need to show support, PFA said.
¡°We think it¡¯s extremely important that the insurance and pension industry take on responsibility to help rebuild liquidity,¡± Lage said.
But eight months is a long time and the risk is that a number of investors will simply have turned elsewhere to plug the gap once filled by Denmark¡¯s bonds. Even Lage acknowledges that investors will ¡°reconsider¡± whether the debt ¡°can be used as part of your fund¡¯s liquid reserves.¡±
¡°Liquidity is obviously important¡± Lage said. But staying away would only exacerbate the risks, he said.
¡°If the government bond market is illiquid, it spills over to the derivative market and then that illiquidity can move over to the mortgage bond market,¡± he said. ¡°So there¡¯s a risk of contagion which we all have a mutual interest in preventing.¡±
In Wednesday¡¯s auction, the debt office will offer its 10-year benchmark, the 1.75 percent note due 2025, as well as its 2.5 percent bond due 2016.
The office doesn¡¯t reveal targets for individual auctions, but has said it will issue 100 billion kroner ($15 billion) in bonds through 2016. Nordea says that isn¡¯t enough to provide the buffer Denmark¡¯s government has traditionally operated with, and predicts the debt office will need to raise its issuance goal for next year by about 25 billion kroner.
Lars Mayland Nielsen, head of the debt office, declined to comment on the sales target. When asked how investors¡¯ liquidity concerns will be handled, he said ¡°the debt office has been in an ongoing dialogue with the market,¡± in an e-mail.

67,"¡®Abnormal¡¯ Trading Drops, FHA Report, Lloyds-BOE: Compliance","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 14 (Bloomberg) -- Unusual share price movements in the two days before takeovers announced by U.K. companies last year fell 9.4 percent, in a sign that insider trading may be decreasing.
There were ¡°abnormal pre-announcement price movements¡± before 21.2 percent of the 118 deal notices in the U.K. in 2010, the Financial Services Authority said in its annual report, published yesterday. That was down from 30.6 percent in 2009, and the lowest rate since 2003.
Factors other than insider trading, such as speculation by analysts or the press about an upcoming deal, or information leaks, could be the cause of the share price movements, the regulator said. The FSA has made market abuse and insider trading by top bankers a focus of its enforcement efforts.
Also over the past year, the FSA required all banks and building societies to carry out reverse stress-testing, where firms list scenarios that could lead to a financial collapse. The watchdog said it will review the results ¡°over the next year or so¡± and respond to the firms that took part.
The FSA implemented rules approved by European Union regulators last year intended to curb incentives for excessive risk-taking last year, imposing limits on cash payouts and the size of bankers¡¯ bonuses.
Compliance Action Rothschild Loses to Evercore as Boutique Left Off FSA Bonus List
Evercore Partners Inc. and Greenhill and Co. will be able to pay employees guaranteed bonuses forbidden at rival deal advisers such as NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd., after escaping scrutiny from the U.K. Financial Services Authority.
Evercore, founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, is among companies offering financial advice such as Gleacher Shacklock LLP and Moelis & Co. that aren¡¯t on a list of 2,776 firms covered by FSA bonus rules. Competitors including Rothschild, New York-based Perella Weinberg Partners LP and Lazard Ltd. are on the list, obtained by Bloomberg News after a Freedom of Information request.
The guidelines apply to firms taking risks with their own cash or that of clients, leading to the exclusion of advisory firms that may not manage money in the U.K. Companies covered by the rules, which must be implemented by next month, can¡¯t offer multiyear guaranteed bonuses and will only be able to pay one-year guarantees in ¡°exceptional circumstances,¡± the FSA said.
The rules enact guidelines approved by European Union regulators last year to curb excessive risk-taking. The FSA expanded the firms covered by bonus rules a hundredfold from the 27 biggest banks to more than 2,700 entities last year to conform to the European guidelines.
Joseph Eyre, FSA spokesman, declined to comment, as did officials at New York-based Moelis, Perella Weinberg, Rothschild, Evercore, Greenhill, Lazard and London-based Gleacher Shacklock.
The agency applied the guidelines from the EU to its revised bonus rules and separated financial firms into four groups based on their size.

U.S. Regulator Says Taxpayers Still at Risk From Fannie, Freddie
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage companies operating under U.S. control, are improving their financial condition but remain a risk to taxpayers, the companies¡¯ regulator reported.
In its third annual report to Congress released yesterday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said improved underwriting on the loans that the companies package into mortgage-backed securities helped slow the agencies¡¯ losses to $28 billion in 2010, from $93.6 billion a year earlier.
The agency ¡°has improved underwriting standards for loan purchases in the past two years,¡± Edward DeMarco, its acting director, said in the report.
Still, DeMarco said, the companies ¡°remain critical supervisory concerns,¡± largely because of a backlog of bad loans originated from 2005 to 2007.
The government-run enterprises, which own or guarantee more than half of the $10 trillion U.S. mortgage market, operated as private companies before they were taken into government conservatorship in September 2008 after soaring losses linked to subprime home loans. Since then, Washington-based Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of McLean, Virginia, have survived on a promise of unlimited U.S. aid and drawn more than $160 billion in Treasury Department funding.

OCC Extends Deadline for Mortgage-Servicer Action Plans
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice, has extended the deadline for action plans required under consent orders issued on April 13 against eight residential mortgage servicers.
The 30-day extension will allow coordination by federal and state agencies, the OCC said yesterday in a statement.
Barclays Will Pay U.K. Customers¡¯ Payment Insurance Claims
Barclays Plc will reimburse the full payment-protection insurance premiums plus 8 percent interest to customers whose claims were put on hold during a court challenge.
The bank will compensate customers sold payment-protection insurance without being told they could buy it from another lender, Barclays said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The British Bankers¡¯ Association, an industry group, lost a court challenge in April to the Financial Services Authority¡¯s PPI guidelines.
Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc were given more time to handle the customer complaints by the FSA yesterday after the court challenge created a backlog. Barclays said in May it would set aside 1 billion pounds ($1.63 billion) to resolve the claims.
The banks have as much as 16 weeks to respond to the complaints, rather than eight weeks, the Financial Services Authority said in a statement yesterday.
PPI generates as much as 5.5 billion pounds in annual revenue for U.K. banks, the FSA has estimated.
ECB-German Standoff Risks Damage That May Force Compromise
The confrontation between the European Central Bank and Germany over bailing out Greece risks causing so much damage that officials may be forced to compromise.
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble are at odds over investors¡¯ role in the second Greek rescue in 14 months. The dispute turns on how politicians make good on a promise to push creditors to pay some of the cost, a step that Trichet said on June 9 could be an ¡°enormous mistake.¡±
Unless a deal can be struck to guarantee Greece¡¯s financing needs for the next 12 months, the International Monetary Fund has threatened to withhold its share of what remains of Greece¡¯s original 110 billion-euro ($159 billion) bailout. Finance ministers have called a special meeting scheduled for today as they try to avoid what European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn called a ¡°Lehman Brothers catastrophe on European soil.¡±
The cost to insure Greek debt against default, already the most expensive in the world, rose to a record yesterday and bonds of Europe¡¯s bailed-out nations slumped. The swaps indicate a 74 percent chance of default in the next five years.
The debt crisis has already forced Trichet to tear up the rule book. The ECB is lending unlimited amounts of cash to support banking systems and has relaxed collateral requirements.

Lloyds Poised to End Bank of England Support, Canaccord Says
Lloyds Banking Group Plc, the U.K.¡¯s biggest mortgage lender, may wean itself off emergency central bank funding support by the end of the month, according to an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Ltd.
The Bank of England yesterday said lenders had reduced dependence on its Special Liquidity Scheme to 37 billion pounds ($60 billion) at the end of May, from 185 billion pounds in January 2009. Lloyds, led by Antonio Horta-Osorio had about 26 billion pounds of support from the program remaining at the end of March.
Lloyds, 41 percent government-owned, and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Britain¡¯s biggest taxpayer-owned bank, were the biggest users of the scheme, introduced during the 2008 banking crisis to allow lenders to swap hard-to-trade mortgage-backed securities for government bonds and so improve liquidity. The termination of government and central bank support is a vital prerequisite for the sale of taxpayer¡¯s bank stakes, analysts have said.
Horta-Osorio, who succeeded Eric Daniels in May, will outline his strategy for Lloyds on June 30.

Ex-Trader Alexander to Pay $1.6 Million for Manipulating Shares
A self-employed trader was fined 700,000 pounds ($1.15 million) and ordered to pay more than 300,000 pounds in restitution for manipulating the price of shares traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Barnett Michael Alexander, a former private-client stockbroker, made multiple small buy and sell orders in an effort to manipulate the price of contracts-for-differences, or CfDs, and spread bets so he could benefit, the Financial Services Authority said in a statement today. He generated a 629,130-pound profit over 16 months, the FSA said. The regulator banned him from working in the finance industry for five years.
The regulator obtained a permanent injunction against Alexander committing market abuse. The Glasgow-based trader qualified for the FSA¡¯s standard 30 percent discount for cooperating with the probe and must pay restitution of 301,005 pounds to City Index Ltd., 4,609 pounds to London Capital Group Holdings Plc, and 17,204 pounds to Monecor (London) Ltd.
A number for Alexander wasn¡¯t available from the FSA registry and the agency couldn¡¯t immediately provide contact information for his attorney.
Courts/Arbitration Panels UBS Loses Finra Arbitration Case Brought by Former 76ers Owner
UBS AG, Switzerland¡¯s biggest bank, will pay Pat Croce, former part-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, about $2 million to compensate for losses on structured products backed by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
A Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel ruled June 9 that UBS is responsible for $1.52 million plus interest in damages. A UBS broker sold $2 million of ¡°principal-protected¡± Lehman notes to Croce and his wife, Diane, on June 25, 2008, less than three months before the bank failed, said Jacob Zamansky, their attorney.
The Zurich-based bank sold $1 billion of the Lehman products to U.S. investors, according to spokeswoman Allison Chin-Leong. It¡¯s been ordered to repay investors some or all of their losses in seven of the eight cases involving the securities that have been decided by Finra panels.
The broker who sold the notes has since quit the firm, saying he was misled by UBS, Zamansky said. The New York-based lawyer has more than 40 pending cases against UBS for Lehman ¡°100% Principal-Protection Notes,¡± totaling more $25 million, he said.
¡°The vast majority of Lehman notes were sold appropriately,¡± and the failure of Lehman was ¡°unexpected and unprecedented,¡± Chin-Leong said. The panel voted 2 to 1 and didn¡¯t provide a reason for its decision.
Banks create structured products by bundling debt with derivatives and offer them to individual investors as an alternative to traditional investments.
Ex-Galleon Trader Zvi Goffer Convicted of Insider Trading
Former Galleon Group LLC hedge fund trader Zvi Goffer was convicted on all counts by a federal jury in Manhattan in the second trial to result from the U.S. government¡¯s nationwide crackdown on insider trading.
Goffer¡¯s brother Emanuel and Michael Kimelman were also found guilty of conspiracy and securities fraud yesterday by a jury that began deliberations June 2. The verdict comes about a month after Goffer¡¯s boss, Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, was found guilty in the same courthouse of directing the biggest hedge fund insider trading scheme in history.
Rajaratnam and Zvi Goffer were key players in three overlapping insider-trading conspiracies that implicated banks, technology firms, hedge funds and so-called expert networking firms.
Goffer, 34, his brother and Kimelman were charged with using tips from two lawyers to profit on trades in 3Com Corp., Axcan Pharma Inc., Kronos Inc. and Hilton Hotels Corp.
Zvi Goffer¡¯s lawyers argued their client sometimes bluffed about having inside information to impress other Wall Street traders. Lawyers for Emanuel Goffer and Kimelman said that their clients weren¡¯t part of any alleged conspiracy with Zvi Goffer.
Rajaratnam, who was convicted on all 14 counts against him, faces as long as 19 1/2 years in prison when he¡¯s sentenced on July 29.
The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Comings and Goings Obama Picks Martin Gruenberg to Succeed Bair at FDIC
President Barack Obama intends to nominate Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vice Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg to succeed Sheila Bair as chairman, according to a White House statement.
Gruenberg has served as the agency¡¯s vice chairman since 2005, and served as acting chairman for six months in 2005 and 2006. Obama announced his selection in an e-mailed statement June 10. Bloomberg News previously reported Obama¡¯s decision.
Gruenberg would replace Bair, who took office in June 2006. Before joining the agency, Gruenberg served as senior counsel to Senator Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, and as staff counsel to the Senate Banking subcommittee on international finance and monetary policy.
His nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate.

68,¡®Abortion Queen¡¯ in Last-Ditch Battle to Save Mississippi Clinic,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Diane Derzis carries a Taser, a Smith and Wesson and a nickname: ¡°abortion queen.¡±
¡°It doesn¡¯t in any way injure my self-confidence,¡± said Derzis, who owns Mississippi¡¯s last abortion clinic and three others in the U.S. South. ¡°I kind of like being the queen.¡±
Her dominion, though, is shrinking. Derzis¡¯s Birmingham clinic was shut for what Alabama health officials called ¡°a history of deficiencies¡± in what she said was a witch hunt. Now, the Jackson Women¡¯s Health Organization may close, thanks to a law Mississippi¡¯s Republican-led Legislature passed requiring that abortion doctors have admitting privileges at a local hospital.
Derzis, 58, and her lawyers are trying to prevent the state from becoming the first with no abortion clinic, and argued in U.S. District Court yesterday that the requirement is unconstitutional because it will effectively ban the procedure. Judge Daniel P. Jordan III ruled that the law will remain blocked as he considers new material filed by the state.
Derzis, seen as a hero by allies and an enabler of murder by the anti-abortion movement, bought the Jackson clinic two years ago. She had become known in the region after Eric Robert Rudolph bombed her New Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham in 1998, punctuating years of attacks on clinics. The blast killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse.
Abortion-Free State
Politicians now present the greatest threat to Derzis¡¯s professional survival. States passed a record 92 abortion restrictions last year, according to the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, which compiles reproductive-health data. Mississippi joined nine other states with laws requiring admitting privileges when Republican Governor Phil Bryant signed the bill in April.
In the two years that Derzis has owned the Jackson clinic, she has been the largely unnamed force behind a business that lawmakers have made a focus of state politics.
When Bryant signed the law argued in court yesterday, he said he would ¡°continue to work to make Mississippi abortion-free,¡± according to Derzis¡¯s suit. Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves says on his website that the law ¡°not only protects the health of the mother but should close the only abortion clinic in Mississippi.¡±
None of the state¡¯s 120 hospitals is licensed as an abortion facility -- meaning each provides fewer than 10 per month or 100 per year, according to the state health department.
The state, which had 14 providers in 1981, is one of five with a single clinic. Derzis¡¯s facility provided 2,378 in the year ending June 30, 2011, according to Betty Thompson, a spokeswoman.
Dwindling Force
Charlotte Taft, who directs the Abortion Care Network, a Washington nonprofit that seeks to reduce stigma around the practice, treated Derzis¡¯s Birmingham employees for emotional trauma after the 1998 bombing. She says Derzis and she are among a shrinking pool of baby boomers who joined the movement after Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling guaranteeing the right to an abortion.
¡°At this point, our greatest challenge is challenges from the states and that¡¯s what¡¯s happening to Diane Derzis,¡± said Taft. ¡°If anyone can stand up to this assault it could be Diane.¡±
Derzis never unlisted her phone numbers or addresses or made a habit of wearing a bullet-proof vest.
¡°You can¡¯t think about it,¡± she said. ¡°You can¡¯t live like that or you couldn¡¯t live. When you hide from those people, that¡¯s what makes them come after you. They know I¡¯m as crazy as they are.¡±
Packing Heat
Derzis says she can¡¯t remember when she started carrying a firearm.
¡°If I¡¯m going, I¡¯m going to take some of them with me,¡± she told the Associated Press in 1995, after vowing to replace the Beretta pistol she had at the time with a semiautomatic that she now carries in her purse.
Long a magnet for protesters, the Jackson facility requires patients to leave backpacks and purses outside and be buzzed in by an attendant. The metal detector -- a reminder of past violence -- was removed a few months ago, Derzis said.
Derzis credits the anti-abortion movement for creating an environment where the practice is shunned, especially in the South.
¡°They have patience,¡± she says of her opponents. ¡°They are a force to be reckoned with.¡±
Nothing Personal
One of those forces is Terri Herring, national director of the Mississippi-based Pro Life America Network, who has lobbied state lawmakers since 1986. While Derzis isn¡¯t nearly as visible as the Jackson clinic¡¯s doctors or staff, Herring says, she symbolizes an industry that hurts women.
¡°This is not a personal thing for me,¡± said Herring, who helped get the new law passed. ¡°Our goals are not to personally attack anyone.¡±
Derzis, who wears red lipstick and shoulder-length curly blond hair, was born in California and raised in Elkton, Virginia. She has a bachelor¡¯s degree in psychology and sociology from the University of Montevallo, south of Birmingham, and a law degree -- though she didn¡¯t take the bar exam and has never practiced -- from the Birmingham School of Law.
Since 2006, Derzis and her second husband, Sam Hess, have maintained a long-distance relationship. He visits a few times a month from Virginia, where he works on their horse and cattle farm.
Derzis, who has no children, had an abortion in a doctor¡¯s office in 1974 when she was in college and married to her first husband. It was a hostile experience during which she was meant to feel shamed, she says. Shortly after, she made it her mission to make the procedure more comfortable for clients.
She operates the for-profit Jackson clinic and facilities in Birmingham; Columbus, Georgia; and Richmond, Virginia. Her investors include doctors and, until her death two weeks ago, her mother.
Derzis sees her fight to keep the Jackson clinic open as the highest stakes battle yet.
¡°My crown¡¯s a little tarnished at this point,¡± the abortion queen said. ¡°But I¡¯m not dead.¡±

69,"Absolute Devastation Left by Sandy in N.J., Christie Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The Atlantic storm Sandy left a landscape of devastation across much of New Jersey, tearing apart seaside resort towns, ripping houses from foundations and cutting electricity to about two-thirds of homes and businesses.
Six people died in the state because of the storm, and search-and-rescue teams are trying to reach stranded residents, according to police and Governor Chris Christie, 50, who spoke tonight at a news conference in West Trenton.
In Atlantic City, the second-largest U.S. gaming center, parts of the iconic boardwalk washed into the streets. The barrier island towns of Lavallette, Ortley Beach and Seaside Heights were ¡°nearly completely under water,¡± Christie said, as was Moonachie, near New York. A 7-foot pile of debris and two dozen rail cars were cleared from the New Jersey Turnpike and the roadway reopened.
The governor said a four-hour helicopter tour, with stops near beach areas, had left him shaken, as residents¡¯ stories of losing everything blended with his own sadness over ruined boardwalk amusements, such as the log flume in Seaside Heights.
¡°When you¡¯re talking to people in Seattle, Washington, or Kansas City, or Texas, there seems to be always people you run into who have some memory of the Jersey shore, have some experience at the Jersey shore, at some time in their lives, and they talk about the same type of iconic images from the Jersey shore,¡± he said. ¡°It will be disorienting for a lot of folks and disappointing to see a lot of those go away. I hope many of them will be replaced.¡±
Obama Visit
President Barack Obama will join Christie tomorrow in New Jersey, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. The governor and president will speak with first responders and people affected by the storm, he said.
Christie, a campaign surrogate for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, praised Obama for declaring a ¡°major disaster¡± in the state, clearing the way for immediate federal assistance to eight storm-damaged counties. Christie said he didn¡¯t care about presidential politics with Election Day a week away.
¡°I don¡¯t give a damn about Election Day. It doesn¡¯t matter a lick to me,¡± he said. ¡°At the moment I have much bigger fish to fry than that and so do the people of the state of New Jersey. So let the politicians who are on the ballot worry about Election Day. It¡¯s not my problem.¡±
Power Failure
The power failure was New Jersey¡¯s largest to be caused by a storm. About 2.6 million homes and businesses in the state were without electricity, twice the number affected by Hurricane Irene in August 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Jersey City, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, and Newark, the state¡¯s largest city with 277,000 residents, suffered total power losses, Christie said.
¡°Our state woke up today to absolute devastation,¡± Christie said at an earlier press briefing. ¡°There are no words to describe what¡¯s been New Jersey¡¯s experience over the last 24 hours, and what we¡¯ll have to contend with over the coming days, weeks and months.¡±
Parts of Moonachie were turned into a lake. Gas stations and restaurants were flooded. Water was knee deep on Moonachie Avenue. Magazines, bottles and clothing floated nearby.
About 1,500 people from Moonachie and nearby Little Ferry went to a shelter at Bergen County Technical High School in Teterboro. Many had been rescued after a tidal surge pushed the Hackensack River over its banks. They crowded into National Guard trucks and school buses carrying garbage bags filled with clothes, stuffed animals and other belongings.
Floating Refrigerator
Brian Sinclair, 54, of Little Ferry said his first floor was submerged.
¡°It was like the water got shot out of a cannon, it gushed so fast,¡± he said as he walked his dog.
Jackie Garcia, 45, standing outside the shelter with her husband and 15-year-old son, said the water started flowing into their house in Little Ferry about 9 p.m. yesterday. By the time they were rescued by a National Guard truck this afternoon, the water inside was 6 feet deep.
¡°It was gushing,¡± Garcia said. ¡°The refrigerator and washer were floating.¡±
About 4,500 residents were in New Jersey shelters, Christie said, down 1,000 people from earlier in the day.
On one street in Maplewood, west of New York City, Joe Anello, 27, from Glen Ridge-based Trusty Tree, examined damage where five trees hit five houses.
Atlantic City
¡°We can¡¯t get the cranes out of Glen Ridge -- there is so much damage we can¡¯t even make it to the end of the block,¡± Anello said as he looked at an oak that had displaced the sidewalk and crushed the roof of an 80-year-old Tudor Revival. ¡°You try to prioritize. But there is so much that it¡¯s pretty much first come, first served.¡±
In Atlantic City, a repair crew was assessing the damage to Caesars Atlantic City Hotel & Casino on Pacific Avenue, where white square sections of the roof had blown off. A chunk of tan siding the size of a house door came off the Trump Plaza hotel, and a broken water line there flooded Missouri Avenue.
¡°I¡¯ve never in my life seen water like that,¡± said Yolanda French, of Atlantic City, as she shopped at a convenience store called Food4Less. ¡°I was so, so scared.¡±
She couldn¡¯t get out of the city and rode the storm out with her two daughters, Sydney, 17, and Porsha, 21. Their apartment complex doesn¡¯t have power.
¡°It¡¯s so cold in the apartment, I got to use the stove for heat,¡± she said.
Boardwalk Debris
Part of the Atlantic City boardwalk crashed into Celphia Connor¡¯s garage. A 10-foot wooden ladder, a large white cooler and Christmas ornaments that didn¡¯t belong to her added to the debris, said Connor, 42.
¡°I never expected that my garage and all my neighbors¡¯ garages would be caved in from all the water and boardwalk,¡± she said.
At The Ocean apartments along the Atlantic City beach, some of the 100 residents used two black charcoal grills in the vented basement parking garage to make community meals of hot dogs and chicken.
¡°The city said they aren¡¯t coming out until they clear the city streets,¡± resident Tamara Barley, 29, said in an interview from the building¡¯s main lobby. Barley said she remained with her two children, Tyjur, 9, and Mahrod, 7, because she didn¡¯t have anywhere to go.
Ainalem Siyoum, 48, said the city abandoned the tenants. ¡°Nobody came to get us,¡± she said of why many didn¡¯t evacuate.
¡®Scariest Moment¡¯
In Ocean County, Esther Sarabella of the Shelter Cove section of Toms River, just inland from Seaside Heights, said that at the start of the storm, high water from the Barnegat Bay trapped her and her 78-year-old mother in their Range Rover. They climbed out the windows.
¡°Being stuck in that car was the scariest moment of my life,¡± Sarabella said today. ¡°You think you¡¯re going to drown, there¡¯s not a soul around you and you don¡¯t know how you¡¯re getting out.¡±
In Ocean City, power lines and telephone cables were dangling in many neighborhoods. A candy machine lay on its side near Ocean Avenue, after floating two blocks from its original position on the boardwalk. Sand was inches deep on roads. Police blocked the only bridge into town.
Flooded Restaurant
Marie Repici, 81, owner of a building housing a hat shop and two restaurants, including her own, the Chatterbox, rode out the storm and watched as water crept into the building. She lives above the Chatterbox, two blocks from the Ocean City boardwalk. During the storm, she and her children and grandchildren tried to keep out the water with sandbags, old beach towels and ¡°anything we could find,¡± Repici said.
Despite their efforts, more than a foot of water flooded the restaurant, warping the wooden booths and leaving dark watermarks on pink walls. A brown film marred a glass display case that had been stocked with candy.
¡°This is the worst it¡¯s ever been,¡± Repici said as her grandsons cleaned up around her.
Two doors down, a fallen 35-foot pine tree damaged a home¡¯s second-story porch. At a Dunkin¡¯ Donuts on 10th Street, a 15-foot wide freezer was pulled off its foundation and dropped on its side.
Sections of Wildwood, a barrier island about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from where Sandy made landfall, remained underwater and businesses were sandbagged. Streets were covered with seaweed and debris and water bubbled up through manhole covers.
¡®Mother Nature¡¯
Judy Simpson, 52, took a bicycle ride to survey the damage in Wildwood. She said she was the sole resident of her Dock Street neighborhood, where her house is raised on pilings, to ignore orders to evacuate by 4 p.m. Oct. 28.
¡°Mother Nature is very violent when she wants to be,¡± she said. ¡°I think it could have gotten a lot worse. We were lucky here.¡±
In Cape May, buildings and homes along the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay sides appeared to have little damage, aside from some fallen siding and wet basements. Some streets were flooded and others covered with sand.
The storm took a toll on the shoreline, eroding the beach on the Delaware side and creating a six-foot wall of sand.
Some residents said they hadn¡¯t felt the need to evacuate.
¡°Going through Irene and not having any real damage, it made us feel like we could survive,¡± said Marta Kulkowitz, 28, who manages a family restaurant in Cape May called the Mad Batter. It will be open for breakfast tomorrow.

70,"¡®Absolutely Not True¡¯ U.S. Withheld Volt Defect, LaHood Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Dec. 8 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. auto-safety investigators needed time to determine if a General Motors Co. Chevrolet Volt or another vehicle was the source of a fire after a May crash test, which is why they didn¡¯t immediately disclose the information, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said.
It¡¯s ¡°absolutely not true¡± that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration withheld information about the electric car¡¯s safety, LaHood told reporters today in Washington, when asked about criticism from Congress members including Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican.
¡°We have opened an investigation into battery-related fires that may occur some time after a severe crash,¡± LaHood said. ¡°Chevy Volt owners can be confident that their cars are safe to drive.¡±
GM, which has made the Volt one of the centerpieces of its U.S. marketing, has offered loaner cars or to buy back Volts from owners concerned about safety. The Volt has been on the U.S. market for a year and went on sale in all 50 states in October. Detroit-based GM sold 6,142 Volts this year through November.
Issa today asked GM Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson to answer a series of questions on the Volt¡¯s ¡°battery system safety deficiencies¡± and when it discovered there was the possibility of fires.
Toyota Analogy
¡°As you may remember, there was considerable public outrage when Toyota Motor Corp. delayed disclosing faulty accelerator pedal concerns in an attempt to further study the problem,¡± Issa wrote. His committee held a hearing in February 2010 at which Toyota President Akio Toyoda testified about the automaker¡¯s record recalls.
LaHood¡¯s agency last month disclosed that a Volt caught fire three weeks after being crash-tested at a NHTSA test facility on May 12. U.S. regulators opened an investigation Nov. 25 into the safety of the Volt¡¯s lithium-ion batteries, which are supplied by Seoul-based LG Chem Ltd.
NHTSA isn¡¯t investigating Nissan Motor Co.¡¯s Leaf or Tesla Motors Inc.¡¯s Roadster, both of which have lithium-ion batteries.
Crash-Test Rating
Issa also was one of three U.S. House members who sent a letter yesterday to NHTSA Administrator David Strickland saying regulators ¡°deliberately suppressed public knowledge of the safety risk posed by the Chevrolet Volt¡¯s lithium-ion battery system.¡±
A subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, headed by Issa, plans a hearing on the matter in late January.
LaHood and Strickland declined to comment on whether the Volt should retain its top crash-safety rating from the U.S. and on what investigators have found so far.
¡°As soon as we have additional information on our testing and on our investigation, we¡¯ll disclose it,¡± LaHood said. Regulators announced the Volt investigation the end of Nov. 25, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

July 30 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. lawmakers allied with the ¡°absolutist¡± Tea Party have put the nation on the financial brink with their aversion to compromise, Senator Lisa Murkowski said.
¡°I am really worried about where we are standing, and I think part of that has come about because you have individuals that say it is my ¡®way or the highway,¡¯¡± Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said yesterday in an interview at Bloomberg¡¯s Washington office. ¡°That is not how you govern.¡±
House Republicans backed by the Tea Party have vowed to support an increase in the $14.3 trillion debt limit only if it¡¯s accompanied by spending cuts and doesn¡¯t raise taxes. President Barack Obama and Democrats propose a mix of tax increases and spending reductions.
¡°You have folks who are so black-and-white, who are so absolutist, that we are in a process now where we are on the brink,¡± said Murkowski, 54, who was defeated by a Tea Party supporter last year in a Republican primary and then re-elected as a write-in candidate.
The senator said she backs the proposal advanced by the Gang of Six, ¡°or some iteration of it.¡± The bipartisan group of senators called the Gang of Six has proposed to cut the budget deficit by $3.7 trillion using a combination of spending cuts and an overhaul of taxes that would raise $1 trillion. Obama endorsed the plan, while House Republicans balked at the tax increases.
¡®Damaging The Process¡¯
¡°Those that believe that compromise is a dirty word, that believe that there is no place for compromise within their efforts, I think are damaging the process,¡± she said yesterday.
U.S. borrowing will exceed congressional authority on Aug. 2 unless Congress raises the debt ceiling, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said.
A short-term extension of borrowing authority may be the best option to prevent a U.S. default, giving lawmakers more time to wrestle with plans to cut the deficit, Murkowski said.
¡°I think that has to be our fallback position,¡± she said.
The Federal Reserve is preparing guidance for banks in the event the debt limit isn¡¯t raised and the Treasury Department runs out of money to pay all of its bills, a government official said yesterday.
The guidance would cover issues including how payments on short-term loans are made, collateral pledged for loans as well as other supervisory and regulatory matters, said the official, who asked not to be identified because congressional negotiations on the debt limit are still under way.
Credit Rating
A credit-rating downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities caused by a failure to increase the borrowing authority would affect collateral pledged for loans.
Standard & Poor¡¯s on July 14 said there¡¯s a 50 percent chance the U.S. AAA rating would be cut from the highest grade within 90 days even if an agreement is reached by Aug. 2. S&P said it needs to see ¡°a credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.¡±
The Senate is unified to ensure the U.S. meets its debt obligations, according to Murkowski.
¡°I think we avoid the default,¡± she said. ¡°I don¡¯t know if we avoid the downgrade, and I¡¯ve got real concerns about that.¡±
The debt and budget issues are ¡°sucking the air out of the room¡± for other issues, Murkowski said. ¡°And if in fact we go into a situation where it¡¯s a short-term extension, my fear is that this will continue for the balance of the year,¡± resulting in very little new legislation.

72,"¡®Abundant¡¯ Thai Rice Supply to Depress Prices, UN Agency Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 4 (Bloomberg) -- Increased rice supplies from Thailand, the biggest shipper, may help to boost global stockpiles and cap prices, the Food and Agriculture Organization said, mitigating record food costs that have pushed millions more into poverty.
¡°There is enough production in the world to keep prices down,¡± Concepcion Calpe, a senior economist at the United Nations¡¯ agency, said in an e-mail interview. Thai supplies may be ¡°abundant¡± this year, with rising output helping to boost reserves, Calpe wrote, without giving precise forecasts.
Global food prices reached a record in February, driving 44 million more people into extreme poverty, according to a World Bank estimate that month. Lower prices of rice, the staple for half the world, may help to ease global inflationary pressures and cut costs for buyers such as cereal maker Kellogg Co.
¡°African and Asian consumers should be smiling,¡± Tom Slayton, an Alexandria, Virginia-based rice analyst and former publisher of The Rice Trader, said by e-mail. If the Thai crop forecast is accurate, ¡°world rice prices are not going to follow the other grains and are likely to decline.¡±
Rice has lagged behind as corn and wheat rallied on harvest disruptions and stronger demand. Corn has jumped 96 percent over the past year in Chicago, while wheat has rallied 54 percent and soybeans have risen 38 percent. Rice, up 25 percent in Chicago, may be ¡°separating us from a food crisis.¡± Abdolreza Abbassian, a senior economist at the FAO, said in March.
Competition from Vietnam, ¡°also tends to depress rice prices in Thailand,¡± Calpe wrote in the April 28 e-mail. The Southeast Asia nation, the world¡¯s second-largest shipper, may export more than 7 million tons this year, the FAO said in a report on its website on May 2.
Thai Prices
Thai rice-export prices, the benchmark for Asia, have dropped 9 percent since Feb. 9, and the 100 percent, grade-B variety was at $508 per metric ton on April 27. Rough-rice futures in Chicago traded at $15.405 per 100 pounds at 9.13 a.m. in Singapore today, 7.8 percent higher this year. The Chicago price peaked at a record $25.07 in April 2008.
Thai rice ¡°production this year should be plentiful,¡± Thosakdi Vanichkajorn, director-general of the Thai Meteorological Department, said in an interview. ¡°The weather now is suitable for planting rice, unlike last year when the main planting season was pushed off as rains were delayed.¡±
Record global food costs squeeze the world¡¯s poor hardest as they can spend more than half of their incomes on feeding themselves, according to a Feb 15. estimate from World Bank President Robert Zoellick. The food-price surge is also boosting inflation worldwide, spurring central banks from China to the euro region to increase interest rates, potentially curbing consumer spending and slowing economic growth.
Rising Inventories
World inventories of rice may advance 7 million tons to 139 million tons this year, the highest level since 2002, the FAO said in its April Rice Market Monitor. Next year, closing global inventories may surge to 150 million tons, based on a preliminary forecast, it said.
¡°With increasing supplies, Thai rice prices may decline by $20 a ton,¡± said Kiattisak Kanlayasirivat, a director at Novel Commodities SA¡¯s Thai office, who correctly forecast a rally late last year. Still, demand from Africa and the Middle East will likely support prices, Kiattisak said. Novel trades about $600 million of rice a year.
The secondary Thai crop, which is being harvested through to July, is forecast to climb 6.3 percent to a record 9.42 million tons, the Office of Agricultural Economics, a forecaster under the farm ministry, said on its website on April 21. The main harvest, which represents 70 percent of total output, may gain 4.6 percent to a two-year high of 23.2 million tons in the year starting October, according to the farm ministry.
¡®Will Be Bearish¡¯
¡°Should this forecast be borne out by monsoonal developments, this will be bearish for U.S. and Vietnamese exporters,¡± wrote Slayton, the Virginia-based analyst. The U.S. is the world¡¯s third-largest shipper, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA.
About 90 percent of the world¡¯s rice is grown in Asia and it¡¯s the staple for more than 3 billion people worldwide, according to the Los Banos, Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI. When rice tripled in 2008, 100 million were driven into poverty, according to IRRI¡¯s website.
Lower rice prices may benefit cereal makers such as Kellogg and General Mills Inc. as well as buyers like Uncle Ben¡¯s, Slayton wrote, referring to the brand owned by Mars Inc., which also makes Spearmint gum and Whiskas pet food.
Thailand, which represents one-third of global shipments of 30 million tons, may export 10 million tons in 2011, near a record 10.1 million shipped in 2004, the USDA said on April 8.
While Thai farmers may harvest more rice, their U.S. counterparts may cut back, favoring other crops. Growers in the U.S. planned to cut rice plantings 17 percent to 3.018 million acres (1.221 million hectares) this year, because of attractive returns for corn, cotton and soybeans.

73,¡®Accidental¡¯ Portsmouth Owners Say They Need Luck to Keep Funds,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- The ¡°accidental owners¡± of the first Premier League soccer team to seek bankruptcy protection say they¡¯ll be lucky not to lose their investment.
Hong Kong-based Balram Chainrai and his Israeli business partner Levi Kushnir took over Portsmouth Football Club for a second time last month. They got control after loaning the English south-coast team 16.5 million pounds ($26.5 million), and almost lost the entire investment when the club twice came within hours of closure over debts of 100 million pounds. They are interested in selling the team.
¡°Both of us got stuck in this situation and the both of us became accidental owners,¡± Chainrai, who runs a consumer products business, said in an interview alongside Kushnir. ¡°If we get out of this without getting hurt, we¡¯ll consider ourselves lucky.¡±
Portsmouth sought protection from creditors in February after U.K. authorities tried to force its closure over unpaid taxes. The team was demoted from the top division at the end of last season after being hit with a nine-point penalty that left it last in the standings of the world¡¯s richest soccer league.
Chainrai and Kushnir, who¡¯ve worked together on property deals, became the club¡¯s fourth owners in six months earlier this year when a group controlled by Saudi Arabian Ali Al-Faraj couldn¡¯t repay them the loan. The club was then taken over by administrators, who ran it for eight months, before the duo took over again Oct. 24. They¡¯ve agreed to repay creditors about 20 percent of what they¡¯re owed.
Near Death
The 112-year-old club was twice close to liquidation. On Feb. 10 a judge in London¡¯s High Court turned down a request from tax authorities to close the team. Then, three weeks ago, administrators UHY Hacker Young said Portsmouth would go out of business if Alexandre Gaydamak, one of the club¡¯s former owners and main creditors, didn¡¯t sign off on the deal to Kushnir and Chainrai. He¡¯s owed 30 million pounds.
¡°We were on the verge of losing everything,¡± Kushnir said.
Portsmouth was forced to sell players who¡¯d helped the club win the 2008 F.A. Cup, its first major trophy in more than half a century. Those sales brought in more than 80 million pounds, yet the team still owed in excess of 100 million pounds. Kushnir said officials are still looking into records to see where the money went.
Gaydamak put the club up for sale in mid-2009, saying he wasn¡¯t prepared to fund it, and Standard Bank called in its loan. Sulaiman Al Fahim, a Dubai-based businessman, took control for 44 days before he couldn¡¯t find the finances to run it. The club was then passed to Al-Faraj before being seized by Kushnir and Levi and placed into administration, a form of protection from creditors.
Rule Changes
The negative publicity generated by the financial problems forced the Premier League and the Football League, which is responsible for English soccer¡¯s three lower-tier professional divisions, to change their rules on ownership and governance.
Al-Faraj was able to take control of the team on the strength of legal documents and without meeting Premier League officials. That¡¯s no longer possible.
¡°I was personally shocked how such a huge company didn¡¯t have monitoring or policing procedures,¡± Kushnir said. ¡°Today the Premier League will not just allow somebody to come in and buy a football club with a document that¡¯s been faxed over to them.¡±
Potential owners are required to undergo an interview with league officials, provide future financial information and explain how they plan to operate the team. Portsmouth needs the Football League¡¯s permission to sign new players.
New Style
Chainrai and Kushnir, who¡¯ve never run a sports team, have sought advice from Israeli agent Pini Zahavi and British-based Iranian businessman Kia Joorabchian. They won¡¯t be buying their way back into the Premier League.
¡°What was before in Portsmouth will not be in the future as long as we are owners,¡± Kushnir said. ¡°There will not be a shopping spree of expensive players, taking commitments on a company knowing it will not be able to be settled.¡±
Portsmouth lost 3-2 when it hosted Doncaster Rovers in its last league game on Nov. 13. It stands 14th in the 24-team Championship.

74,"¡®Accidental War¡¯ Threat Mounts in Armenia, Azerbaijan, ICG Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Armenia and Azerbaijan are moving closer to war as tensions rise over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, prompting a ¡°spiraling arms race¡± between the two former Soviet states, the International Crisis Group said.
¡°Lack of progress in the peace talks is increasing the likelihood of an accidental war at any time or an all-out offensive within the next few years,¡± ICG director Sabine Freizer said in a report published on the Brussels-based research group¡¯s website today.
Oil-exporting Azerbaijan and landlocked Armenia fought a war over Nagorno-Karabakh after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 that left tens of thousands of people dead and more than 1 million displaced. Russia, which borders the countries along with Iran, Turkey and Georgia, brokered a cease-fire in 1994, though talks on a final settlement, mediated by Russia, the U.S. and France, have failed to produce a binding agreement.
Surging oil prices allowed Azerbaijan to double military spending to more than $2 billion last year and emboldened President Ilham Aliyev to threaten the use of military force to regain Nagorno-Karabakh.
¡°The past twelve months have seen more cease-fire violations across wider areas, employing more sophisticated tactics and weapons,¡± Freizer said in the report. ¡°The more lethal weaponry both sides are acquiring puts response time on an ever-shorter hair trigger, adding to the risk of accidental conflict.¡±

75,¡®Act of Valor¡¯ Is Top Film With $24.5 Million in Sales,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Act of Valor,¡± from Relativity Media, led the box office in its debut weekend, collecting $24.5 million in ticket sales at U.S. and Canadian theaters.
¡°Tyler Perry¡¯s Good Deeds¡± opened in second place with $15.6 million for Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed statement.
¡°Act of Valor,¡± filmed with active U.S. Navy SEAL forces, broke through in a crowded Oscar weekend that saw four new movies open. Weinstein Co.¡¯s ¡°The Artist,¡± winner last night of five Academy Awards, including best picture, generated $3 million in sales this past weekend after expanding to 966 theaters from 808.
¡°Most of the films that are nominated get a little bit of a bump once they are nominated, and then, of course, films that win an Academy Award get some pretty substantial bumps following,¡± said Paul Sweeney, an analyst for Bloomberg Industries, in a telephone interview.
¡°The King¡¯s Speech¡± received a boost in ticket sales last year after taking the top prize, and ended up grossing more than $400 million in global box office, he said.
¡°The Artist¡± has grossed $31.9 million in domestic theaters since its release on Nov. 25.
¡°We¡¯ve had a tremendous track record with ¡®The Artist¡¯ and should we garner awards, it could have a positive effect on the box office,¡± Erik Lomis, Weinstein Co.¡¯s president of theatrical distribution and home entertainment, said in an interview last week.
The Most Elite
For ¡°Act of Valor,¡± directors Scott Waugh and Mike McCoy hired active-duty SEALs to create realistic action scenes such as a raid on a drug compound. They are out to rescue a missing CIA agent played by Roselyn Sanchez.
SEAL teams, among the most elite of U.S. troops, gained worldwide attention for the May 2011 raid on a safe house in Pakistan that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The film cost $12 million to make, according to Hollywood.com.
¡°Hollywood profitability is a difficult thing to achieve,¡± Sweeney said. ¡°It¡¯s hard for lower-budget films to break through, and when they do it tends to be very profitable.¡±
¡®Good Deeds¡¯
Perry, known for the ¡°Madea¡± comedies aimed at African-American audiences, stars in ¡°Good Deeds¡± as a businessman whose scripted life takes an unexpected turn after he does a favor for a single mother, played by Thandie Newton, who works on the cleaning crew in his building.
Perry¡¯s four ¡°Madea¡± movies have taken in $455 million worldwide for Lions Gate, including $288 million in the domestic market.
Returning movies ¡°Journey 2: The Mysterious Islands,¡± ¡°Safe House,¡± and ¡°The Vow¡± rounded out the top five.
¡°Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,¡± from Time Warner Inc.¡¯s Warner Bros., generated $13.4 million, good for $76.6 million in its third weekend. The picture features Dwayne Johnson in a 3-D sequel to the 2009 hit ¡°Journey to the Center of the Earth.¡±
¡°Safe House,¡± from Comcast Corp.¡¯s Universal Pictures, took in $10.9 million, falling to fourth from first. The film, starring Denzel Washington as a rogue CIA agent, has generated $97.6 million in three weeks.
The romantic drama ¡°The Vow¡± dropped to fifth from second with $9.9 million in receipts for Sony Corp.¡¯s Screen Gems unit. The film, starring Channing Tatum as a man whose wife awakens from a coma with no memory of their marriage, has drawn $102.9 million in U.S. ticket sales.
Out of Top Five
A pair of major new releases failed to crack the top five. Universal¡¯s R-rated comedy ¡°Wanderlust¡± made its debut in eighth place with $6.5 million. The movie stars Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd as a New York couple that stumbles on a hippie commune.
¡°Gone,¡± from Summit Entertainment, starring Amanda Seyfried as a woman searching for a sister who has been abducted, was ninth with $4.8 million.
¡°That¡¯s a disappointment for both of them,¡± Sweeney said. ¡°They weren¡¯t well reviewed, and there was different types of box office behavior given the Academy Awards and people going to see the nominated films.¡±
Weekend revenue for the top 12 films rose 19 percent to $114.2 million from a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Attendance is up 20 percent year to date, while revenue is up 18 percent. The amounts below are based on actual tickets sales for Feb. 24 through Feb 26.

76,"¡®Addams Family¡¯ Fans Ignore Bad Reviews, Buy Tickets","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 18 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°The Addams Family¡± opened on Broadway in April to horrible reviews and looked like a $16.5 million bomb. The musical¡¯s prospects seemed to grow even dimmer when it was shut out at the Tony Awards in June.
Somehow, ticket buyers never got the message.
Last week, the three top-performing shows in average ticket price were ¡°The Lion King¡± ($122.44), ¡°Wicked¡± ($119.81) and ¡°The Addams Family¡± ($114.31). The first two are certified blockbusters, having run a total of 20 years while consistently filling 90 percent or more of their seats.
¡°The Addams Family,¡± with a top ticket of $135, has turned out to be another show customers are willing to pay full price to see.
Some of the more critically acclaimed musicals to open last season -- including ¡°American Idiot,¡± ¡°Fela!¡± and the best musical Tony winner ¡°Memphis¡± -- have sweated to fill seats this summer, with discounted tickets selling in the $75 to $88 range.
¡°The Addams Family¡± has repaid investors almost 50 percent of their money after just 18 weeks, according to members of the producing team who declined a request to release precise figures.
Word Of Mouth
More important, word-of-mouth is strong. Theatergoers are telling their friends they loved what the New York Times called a ¡°collapsing tomb¡± and a ¡°genuinely ghastly musical¡± (and that was just in the first paragraph).
I should point out that Bloomberg News¡¯s John Simon enjoyed ¡°The Addams Family¡± and anticipated the audience response when he wrote that ¡°the whole show is a menage a trois of the ghastly, the ghostly and the side-splitting. And you know what? Unlike in most current musicals, the songs really shine: Melody, too, has risen from the dead.¡±
Audience surveys financed by the producers told them that Charles Addams is no more relevant to the ticket buyers than the Times.
¡°I go back to watch the audience, and the thrill is seeing how deeply in love with the show they are,¡± said Andrew Lippa, who wrote the music and lyrics, earning ¡°The Addams Family¡± one of its two Tony nominations (the other was for supporting actor Kevin Chamberlin, who plays Uncle Fester).
¡°They run out of clever ways to say how thrilled they are. It¡¯s only gotten better,¡± Lippa added, speaking from a car on the way to his country house in Pennsylvania.
Gun-Shy Producers
The producers, led by former investment banker Roy Furman and Broadway veteran Stuart Oken, already were gun shy from the experience of opening the show.
After a rocky opening in Chicago, the transfer to New York was dogged by gossip about an acrimonious relationship between Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth, who play the heads of the bizarre Addams clan, Gomez and Morticia. There were also questions about whether Lippa and book writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice would be able to fix the show in time for the Broadway opening.
Fix they did, dropping songs that weren¡¯t working, adding new material and making sure the opening number told the audience to relax and have a good time.
For the producers were counting on one thing that has proven to be true: The Addams Family brand has nothing to do with the Addams drawings and everything to do with the television sitcom that ran from 1964 to 1966 -- prime Baby Boomer time.
¡°While audiences definitely want to see both Nathan and Bebe, the primary motivating factor for those who have bought tickets and those inclined to see the show is their affection for the characters -- in a very nostalgic, fun sense -- due to the TV series primarily,¡± said a member of the production team.
While Lane and Neuwirth are certified Broadway stars --with unusually long contracts that will keep them in the show through the spring of 2011 -- ¡°The Addams Family¡± has not been promoted as a star vehicle.
¡°The show has been positioned from the start highlighting the family and the cartoons, not the stars, to build for the long-term,¡± a producer of the show said. ¡°The Vic Mizzy TV theme has been used extensively in both TV and radio ads. It has tremendous recognition value for the public. They only need to hear ¡®DA-DA-DA DUM, snap, snap,Â DA-DA-DA DUM, snap, snap,¡¯ to instantly pay attention and smile.¡±

77,'Advanced Energy' Wants to Ramp Up Most EverythingÃ But Coal,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
A year-old energy-industry organization released a report today that describes a global clean-energy market of more than $1 trillion and how businesses in the United States can get a bigger piece of it.Â 
Advanced Energy Economy (AEE) has set out with lofty goals and a staff of 20 to help U.S. businesses sort through the expanding opportunities they face today in generating, selling and buying electricity and fuel. The San Francisco-based groupÂ has opened chapters in seven states and one in New England, as it tries to rewire professional networks to make it easier for businesses to educate themselves, develop policy and share data. Think of it as a Chamber of Commerce for energy sources cleaner than coal or oil.Â 
Unlike industry- or technology-specific groups, such as the American Wind Energy Association or the Solar Industry Association, AEE is trying to identify and solve challenges that businesses face in understanding and deploying low- or no-carbon energy technologies. It¡¯s trying to build a national network of energy-business forumsÂ and to help potential partners identify each other.Â 
AEE's regional affiliates have more than 600 members. The company plans to expand its national membership in its second year. It currentlyÂ has fewer than 100 national members, among themÂ Verizon Communications, Natel Energy, Austin Water and Recurrent Energy.Â 
""We take our lead from the CEOs of the companies that join us,"" Graham Richard, AEE¡¯s chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview. ""This will be data driven and nonpartisan.""Â 
The report, conducted by Pike Research, shows that the so-called advanced-energy market in 2011 was $1.1 trillion. The largest segment was electricity generation, where global advanced energies accounted forÂ $549.3 billion in 2011 revenue. That includes $257 inÂ hydropower, $113.2 billion inÂ solar, and $67.1 billion in wind.Â 
The advanced-energy market is only expected to grow, AEE says.Â In 2012, the U.S. market alone is estimated to have risen almost 20 percent,Â to $157 billionÂ from $132 billion, according to the report.
AEE, a nonprofit,Â was founded Nov. 7,Â 2011,Â by Tom Steyer, the founder and senior managing member of Farallon Capital Management, and Hemant Tenaja, managing director of General Catalyst Partners. Its board of directors includes such U.S. energy notables as Jim Rogers, chairman, president and CEO of Duke Energy, Samir Kaul, founding general partner at Khosla Ventures, and Michael Ahearn, chairman of FirstSolar.Â 
AEE is also an end-run around the bitter partisanship that dominates energy and climate debates in Washington. The group defines ¡°advanced energy,¡± a novel phrase, as ""the best available commercial technologies for meeting energy needs today and tomorrow."" They divide it into seven market segments -- transportation, buildings, industry, fuel production, fuel delivery, electricity generation and electricity generation and management. Those seven categories break down into 41 sub-segments that include everything from vehicle design to nuclear power. Just not coal or oil.
Let others squabble over how clean, say, nuclear is vs. wind, Richard said. The group is ¡°less worried about exactly what that definition is"" than about helping companies switch to clean andÂ affordable energy.Â

78,¡®Adversarial Shot¡¯ at Goldman Raises Stakes for SEC,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 20 (Bloomberg) -- Robert Khuzami, shortly after becoming the Securities and Exchange Commission¡¯s enforcement chief last year, told Congress the agency must be willing to fight big cases to show it poses a ¡°credible threat.¡±
Targeting Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most profitable company in Wall Street history, in the SEC¡¯s first contested lawsuit against a major investment bank in more than a decade reflects the enforcement unit¡¯s new combative approach.
The stakes for the SEC are high. While winning high-profile cases may help the agency restore its image after being battered by the financial crisis and its failure to detect frauds including Bernard Madoff¡¯s Ponzi scheme, losing may tarnish the SEC¡¯s reputation. Goldman Sachs said it will ¡°vigorously¡± fight the case, which hinges on whether information withheld by the firm should¡¯ve been disclosed to investors.
The lawsuit says: ¡°We¡¯re willing to file big cases, we¡¯re willing to file against the biggest firms, and we¡¯re willing to file about the most complicated stuff,¡± said Mark Radke, a former SEC official now at Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP in Washington.
¡°With this adversarial shot across Goldman¡¯s bow, other banks will feel immense pressure to avoid being cast in a similar light,¡± said Charles Clark, a former SEC enforcement lawyer who works at Kirkland & Ellis LLP in Washington. Firms ¡°may go to extraordinary lengths to avoid a similar fate.¡±
Sophisticated Investors
SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, 54, is expanding protection of so-called sophisticated investors such as pension funds, insurance companies and banks after financial companies worldwide lost more than $1.78 trillion since the start of 2007 in the worst economic crisis since World War II.
¡°The days of ¡®buyer beware¡¯ may be changing,¡± said Todd Henderson, a law professor at the University of Chicago. ¡°In light of the financial crisis and the fact that sophisticated investors aren¡¯t just losing their own money but taxpayers¡¯ money, the interest of regulators is higher.¡±
The SEC on April 16 accused Goldman Sachs of creating and selling collateralized debt obligations in 2007 tied to subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson & Co. helped pick the underlying securities. Goldman Sachs also didn¡¯t disclose to investors that Paulson was betting against the securities, the SEC said.
The SEC¡¯s Republican commissioners, Kathleen Casey and Troy Paredes, opposed the lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, which was approved in a 3-2 vote, two people with knowledge of the matter said yesterday.
¡®Completely Unfounded¡¯
The allegations are ¡°completely unfounded in law and fact,¡± Goldman Sachs said in a statement after the suit was announced. The company said it will fight the claims and ¡°defend the firm and its reputation.¡±
European regulators are following the SEC¡¯s case. Britain¡¯s Financial Services Authority said today it will start a formal probe of Goldman Sachs¡¯s London unit. BaFin, Germany¡¯s financial-services regulator, is requesting information from the SEC about the case.
Khuzami, 53, took the enforcement unit¡¯s helm in March 2009 as lawmakers questioned the SEC¡¯s vigilance and debated its future after Madoff¡¯s fraud and the collapses of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. In May, he told the Senate Banking Committee the agency needed to beef up its trial unit to maintain its courtroom clout and credibility.
¡°We must convey to all defendants in SEC actions that not only do we assemble winning cases against them, but also we are prepared to go to trial and we will win,¡± he said.
Drexel Burnham Lambert
For decades, the SEC brought almost all claims against Wall Street¡¯s biggest investment banks as settled cases. The arrangements let firms avoid legal battles that could damage their businesses. The last time the SEC ¡°went to war¡± against a major investment bank was against Drexel Burnham Lambert, though there may have been smaller cases in the decade that followed, said Dewey & LeBoeuf¡¯s Radke.
Drexel initially fought the SEC¡¯s 1988 lawsuit, which stemmed from an insider-trading probe, by meeting the agency¡¯s lawyers at the courthouse to voice objections. The firm settled the following year.
The Goldman Sachs case may show lawmakers that the SEC is willing to be more confrontational after U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said the agency showed too much deference to Wall Street, said Peter Henning, a former SEC attorney who teaches at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit.
Grassley
Grassley faulted the SEC after an agency official discussed potential enforcement cases against Bear Stearns with JPMorgan Chase & Co. in March 2008 as the government pushed JPMorgan to buy the failing investment bank.
The senator also criticized SEC officials for discussing an investigation into Morgan Stanley Chairman John Mack with the firm¡¯s lawyer in 2005 when the company was considering naming him chief executive officer. Mack, who stepped down as CEO in January, wasn¡¯t accused of wrongdoing by the SEC.
Although the agency warned Goldman Sachs last year that it was investigating and might eventually file a complaint over its dealings in collateralized debt obligations, the SEC didn¡¯t alert the firm before it filed the suit on April 16, according to a person close to the company. People within Goldman Sachs interpreted the absence of a warning as a sign that the SEC has become more confrontational, the person said.
¡®Biggest Kid on the Block¡¯
¡°The SEC picked a fight with the biggest kid on the block,¡± said Henning. ¡°That may be part of the message the commission wanted to send. It may help re-establish their reputation.¡±
An effort to demonstrate the SEC¡¯s renewed vigor backfired in September when a federal judge rejected a $33 million proposed settlement with Bank of America Corp. The agency later broadened its claims, forced the bank to overhaul its corporate governance and pay a $150 million fine.
That stumble and the agency¡¯s failures in the Lehman, Bear Stearns and Madoff cases may have emboldened firms, making them more likely to challenge findings by agency investigators, said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice at Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy & Ecker in Potomac, Maryland.
¡°The level of deference the agency has received historically to its cases is a deference it has lost,¡± Frenkel said. ¡°It can only be reestablished through a chain of more successful enforcement cases.¡±

79,"¡®Aida¡¯ Gets Spinster, No Elephants in Ruinous Staging: Review","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- After the exotic character names ¡°Amneris¡± and ¡°Amonasro¡± listed in the program for Verdi¡¯s opera ¡°Aida,¡± it¡¯s odd to see a character called ¡°Amelia Edwards.¡±
Is she Aida¡¯s long-lost English twin? Her pet cat?
Either of those ideas would work better than the reality. In Stephen Medcalf¡¯s new staging, funded by impresario Raymond Gubbay at London¡¯s Royal Albert Hall, she¡¯s a prim non-singing Victorian archaeologist.
We first see her poking around dusty Egyptian ruins with her parasol. The overture starts and, as if a dream, ancient priests and slaves appear before her and start singing.
¡°Celestial Aida, you are the queen of my thoughts,¡± warbles the love-stricken warrior Radames.
The silent virago (played by Charlotte Medcalf) looks on from a distance, suitably shocked at the hero¡¯s deplorable want of decorum.
Later, Ethiopian prisoners wail ¡°Mercy¡± while Egyptian priests poke them with sticks and cry ¡°Crush, oh King, this savage rabble.¡±
The unimpressed spinster, rather in the manner of Lady Bracknell, manages to suggest by the sheer force of her silent frostiness that a good dose of gripe-water and an early bedtime with no supper would be the best way to cure such fractiousness.
Unendurable
Framing devices are problematic at the best of times. This one is so irritating it makes you want to rip out all your teeth and then start work on your neighbor¡¯s.
It tries to convey the idea, I guess, that ¡°Aida¡± is a product of Victorian Orientalist ideologies: The director wants us to see the tale through a 19th-century lens.
Of a triple-cast show, I saw Indra Thomas (Aida) and Marc Heller (Radames). Both are stodgy actors capable of turning an attractive phrase, even if their voices have some weak spots.
For inexplicable reasons, director Medcalf has Aida strangled by the High Priest, though she does revive for the last duet with Radames.
¡°I made my way here by stealth,¡± she sings to him. ¡°I wished to die in your arms.¡±
So is that why she got herself strangled then? How clever of her.
Tiziano Carraro (Amneris), looking slinky and vampish in a close-fitting white dress, has fire in her belly, and knows how to make a big gesture count for something. She has a good mezzo sound too, even if it lacks an ideal boominess in her chest register.
Many Ruins
Designer Isabella Bywater sets all the action among archaeological ruins. Three screens cover the massive Royal Albert Hall pipe organ, and periodically display images of the Nile and ceremonial Egyptian architecture.
Even so, the famous Grand March doesn¡¯t go with as much swing and grandeur as it needs to, despite plenty of dancers and extra actors, and some solid conducting from Andrew Greenwood.
A quick search reveals that Amelia Edwards (1831-1892) was a real-life writer who became a pioneering Egyptologist. It¡¯s a mite sad that her fascinating achievements have been relegated to the sidelines of a muddle-headed ¡°Aida.¡±
Rating: *Â½.
¡°Aida¡± is at the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Gore, SW7 2AP, until March 11. Information: http://www.royalalberthall.com or +44-20-7589-8212

Dec. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Tighter monetary policy, quickening inflation, a wider current-account deficit and greater risk aversion due to European debt problems mean a year of lower earnings for Turkish banks, HSBC Holdings Plc said in a report.
The U.K. bank lowered its target prices for all banks it covers, while downgrading Yapi & Kredit Bankasi AS, Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi AS and Turkiye Is Bankasi AS to ¡°neutral¡± from ¡°overweight.¡±
Domestic risks are already reflected in prices for Turkish banks, which have underperformed emerging-market banking stocks by about 20 percent since the end of September, according to the report by analyst Tamer Sengun.
Global uncertainties, however, ¡°could have a dramatic impact on the stock prices, either for the better or for the worse,¡± according to the report. ¡°We would expect to become more positive on Turkish banks when the policy makers find a way to contain the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone.¡±
The report is titled ¡°Ain¡¯t no sunshine: rates have gone higher,¡± following a survey issued in September titled ¡°Sunshine through the clouds.¡±

81,"¡®Airbender¡¯ Escapes Deep Freeze, Tries to Save Planet: Movies","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
July 1 (Bloomberg) -- James Cameron isn¡¯t the only director who can make a splashy avatar movie.
The star of M. Night Shyamalan¡¯s ¡°The Last Airbender¡± is an avatar named Aang, a young boy with the power to bring peace to a war-torn planet. Only he can control Air, Water, Earth and Fire, the four classical elements each represented by a tribal nation in the fantasy world created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko.
The bald, tattooed boy, played by 13-year-old taekwondo champion Noah Ringer, is a combination of the Karate Kid and a young Kwai Chang Caine, the spiritual martial-arts master in the 1970s TV series ¡°Kung Fu.¡±
After being frozen in ice for a century, he¡¯s freed by siblings Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) and Katara (Nicola Peltz), members of the peaceful Water Nation who recruit him to join their battle against the warmongering Fire Nation -- a matchup comparable to Mahatma Gandhi trading haymakers with Mike Tyson.
It¡¯s tempting to compare ¡°The Last Airbender¡± to Cameron¡¯s ¡°Avatar.¡± Both are nature-centric parables set in make-believe worlds and both feature elaborate special effects heightened by 3-D. (Unlike ¡°Avatar,¡± though, Shyamalan¡¯s movie was converted after it was shot in 2-D -- a process that diminishes the impact of images flying off the screen.)
TV Series
But that¡¯s where the similarities end. While ¡°Avatar¡± raised the bar for computer-enhanced movies to a new level with its ethereal images, ¡°The Last Airbender¡± is a cartoonish film that can¡¯t transcend its roots as a children¡¯s TV series on Nickelodeon.
Shyamalan, best known for supernatural tales like ¡°The Sixth Sense¡± and ¡°Signs,¡± wrote, directed and co-produced the film, so he must shoulder the blame. Children may identify with the young heroes, but adults will quickly get bored with the pseudo-philosophizing, haphazard editing and inscrutable storytelling.
As the reincarnated avatar, Aang is the only one who can control -- or, in the parlance of the film, bend -- the four elements and stop the Fire Nation from wreaking havoc. When he went into the deep freeze, however, he was so young he had only mastered the art of airbending. He must therefore learn to manipulate the other elements to ward off the evil Fire forces led by Prince Zuko (Dev Patel of ¡°Slumdog Millionaire¡±) and his uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub).
White Actors
At first, it¡¯s entrancing to watch Aang create huge waves, Zuko shoot flames into the sky and a giant lizard climb a fortress wall. But the special effects grow tiresome and we¡¯re left with a bunch of one-dimensional characters engaged in a cliched good versus evil showdown.
Production designer Philip Messina does a commendable job of creating distinct looks for the four nations, especially the ice fortress of the Water tribe. (The movie was shot primarily in Greenland.) As for the look of Aang, Katara and Sokka, Shyamalan has been criticized for using white actors to portray characters that were Asian or Inuit in the TV series.
I doubt changing the color of the actors would have improved the film. What ¡°The Last Airbender¡± needed was a different director.
¡°The Last Airbender,¡± from Paramount Pictures, opens today across the U.S. Rating: *1/2

April 26 (Bloomberg) -- Global demand for energy, metals and crops is outpacing supplies ¡°at an alarming rate,¡± spurring a ¡°permanent shift¡± in values of natural resources, said Jeremy Grantham of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co.
The rising global population, growing consumption in China and smaller supplies of available land are slashing reserves of finite commodities, said Grantham, a co-founder of Boston-based GMO, an investment-management firm. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials is up 32 percent in the past year, sending food prices to a record in February. Yesterday, crude oil reached a 31-month high.
¡°From now on, price pressure and shortages of resources will be a permanent feature of our lives,¡± Grantham, the firm¡¯s chief investment strategist, said in a quarterly report posted on GMO¡¯s website. ¡°This will increasingly slow down the growth rate of the developed and developing world and put a severe burden on poor countries.¡±
Adjusted for inflation, most commodity prices declined about 1.2 percent annually over the previous century, before bottoming in 2002. Since then, ¡°this entire decline was erased by a bigger surge than occurred during World War II,¡± Grantham said. Such growth is ¡°unsustainable,¡± he said.
¡°Statistically, most commodities are now so far away from their former downward trend that it makes it very probable that the old trend has changed,¡± Grantham said. ¡°There is in fact a paradigm shift, perhaps the most important economic event since the Industrial Revolution.¡±

Rupert Murdoch¡¯s 21st Century Fox Inc. is licensing its characters for a themed resort in Dubai in a deal that could lead to as many as five such parks around the world.
20th Century Fox World, Dubai, scheduled to open in 2018, will feature attractions based on films and TV shows such as ¡°Ice Age,¡± ¡°Planet of the Apes,¡± ¡°Aliens¡± and ¡°The Simpsons,¡± as well as a hotel, according to a statement Tuesday. It joins another Fox theme park under construction in Malaysia.
Al Ahli Holding Group, a builder responsible for the Dubai Outlet Mall, the first such project in the Middle East, is developing the resort. The projected cost wasn¡¯t disclosed. The deal allows for as many as three more parks outside of Dubai.
¡°Dubai is the second Fox theme park destination and marks an important step forward in our global theme park strategy,¡± Jeffrey Godsick, president of Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products, said in the statement.
Fox is taking a cue from Walt Disney Co. and Comcast Corp., which are seeing strong profit growth in their theme-park divisions. Attendance at the world¡¯s 25-largest parks rose 4.1 percent to more than 223 million guests last year, according to the Burbank, California-based Themed Entertainment Association.
The company has licensed its characters to parks before. Comcast¡¯s Universal Studios in May expanded its attraction based on ¡°The Simpsons¡± in Los Angeles to include settings from the Fox TV show such as Moe¡¯s Tavern and the Springfield nuclear power plant.
The Middle East is drawing the attention of movie studios, as well as local park developers. Three water parks, in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, made the list of the 10 largest such parks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa last year, according to the industry association. The warm weather there allows water parks to operate year-round.

85,¡®Alpha Woman¡¯ Rousseff to Follow Lula to Brazil¡¯s Silver Screen,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 28 (Bloomberg) -- First there was Lula, the movie. Now former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva¡¯s successor and protÃ©gÃ© is getting her shot at the silver screen.
President Dilma Rousseff¡¯s rise from a student activist who took up arms against Brazil¡¯s dictatorship to her election last year as the country¡¯s first female leader will be told in a new movie based on a biography to be published this month, said Helder Caldeira, author of the upcoming book.
¡°I don¡¯t want it to be a biographical film,¡± Caldeira, who sold to an independent producer the rights to ¡°The First Female President¡± and is now helping write the screenplay, said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. ¡°It¡¯s the story of an alpha woman who rose to power.¡±
Lula¡¯s record 87 percent approval rating in his final year of office didn¡¯t prevent a biopic about his rise from poverty to the apex of power from becoming a box office flop. While ¡°Lula: The Son of Brazil¡± was chosen last year by the government as the country¡¯s submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, the movie was panned as a propaganda piece by critics and attracted less than a fifth of the 5 million viewers its producers had hoped for.
Ticket sales for the movie totaled 7 million reais ($4.43 million), representing 832,320 spectators, according to Filme B, a Brazilian website that tracks movie sales. By comparison, the police action film ¡°Elite Squad 2¡± broke Brazilian box office records last year with more than 11 million spectators.
Rousseff¡¯s office declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.

About 2,400 people with bank accounts in Liechtenstein have agreed to disclose unpaid tax owed to the U.K., the revenue and customs office said.
Mostly wealthy individuals with accounts in the Alpine nation have so far paid 363 million pounds ($564 million) following the introduction of a disclosure facility that aims to raise as much as 3 billion pounds by 2016, the revenue office said. Both nations were expected to sign a double taxation agreement yesterday.
The clampdown comes amid a request for information from the U.S., which is targeting lawyers, accountants, financial advisers, asset managers and those responsible for professional asset protection.
Under pressure from the U.S., Germany and France, Liechtenstein said in March 2009 that it would conform with tax standards set out by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to avoid being blacklisted as a tax haven.
Compliance Policy
Municipal-Bond Regulators Crack Down on Disclosure Enforcement
Municipal-bond regulators are checking to ensure that securities underwriters comply with obligations requiring issuers to meet disclosure obligations, officials said at a government-finance conference.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in the past two weeks began asking underwriters in the $3.7 trillion market to review whether municipalities provided required disclosures when selling bonds, according to Leslie Norwood, vice president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
The SEC has made clear that disclosure must improve in the municipal-bond market, where issuers sometimes produce financial reports late, provide incomplete information or don¡¯t make it available at all. In March, regulators said they would begin checking on whether dealers have been making sure their clients comply, Norwood said.
Under securities law, municipal borrowers don¡¯t have to provide financial and other information, yet their underwriter banks are required to put language in bond documents that forces the issuers to meet disclosure guidelines.
Some dealers didn¡¯t maintain and didn¡¯t require issuers to maintain adequate written evidence that they complied with disclosure obligations, according to the March alert sent by the SEC. Failure to comply with due diligence on its obligation can lead to violations of anti-fraud provisions of securities laws and other SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board rules, the alert said.
Spanish Banks May Be Offered EFSF Bonds, European Official Says
The euro region¡¯s temporary bailout fund may help Spanish banks by giving them bonds that could be used as collateral, a step used to help Greek lenders since April, a European official said.
Should Spain request help from the European Financial Stability Facility, the fund could potentially transfer new bonds to the country¡¯s FROB rescue program, said the official, who spoke on terms of anonymity because an application has yet to be made. The program would then transfer the bonds to Spanish banks in exchange for shares, while FROB would remain liable for the debt. Greek banks have used the debt as collateral that can be deposited at the European Central Bank to raise cash.
The move would allow the Spanish government to channel aid directly to its bank rescue facility without drawing on market issuance to recapitalize the lenders, said the official.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel¡¯s government said yesterday that Spain¡¯s bailout program should draw from the ESM, which offers preferred seniority in insolvency proceedings and is prefinanced through its own cash reserves.
EU Criticized With U.S. for Bank Rules Weaker Than Basel III
The U.S., European Union and Japan may fail to fully implement bank-capital rules drawn up to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, global watchdogs warned.
International teams of regulators have found weaknesses in the nations¡¯ implementing measures for the so-called Basel III standards, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said yesterday in a statement on its website.
Preliminary assessments of the EU, the U.S. and Japan ¡°have identified areas of divergence¡± with the Basel accord, the group said. There are ¡°key areas where domestic implementation may be weaker than the globally agreed standards.¡±
Nations face a January 2013 deadline set by the Basel committee for implementing the new rules, which more than triple the core capital that lenders must have to stave off insolvency, and require banks to build up buffers of easy-to-sell assets. The measures were published by the group in 2010.
Yesterday¡¯s report sets out preliminary findings by the review teams, which plan further ¡°on site¡± visits by the end of July, the group said.

Bankers Cite ¡®Confusion¡¯ Over Federal Reserve Stress Test
A group of U.S. bankers that advises the Federal Reserve urged supervisors last month to reduce the ¡°uncertainty and confusion¡± posed by the most recent test of banks¡¯ ability to weather financial turmoil.
Members of the Federal Advisory Council said the uncertainty was generated by the ¡°significant differences¡± between the analysis used by the Fed in its stress-test models and those used by participating banks, said the memo describing the May 11 meeting released today by the Fed.
¡°Those disparities place bank boards in a highly vulnerable position,¡± the memo said. ¡°Board members are literally compelled to ¡®fly blind,¡¯ in effect guessing about high-stakes capital distribution decisions that can tip the balance between the success of passing¡± the stress test and ¡°the market punishment associated with failure.¡±
Tension between banks and regulators has grown as agencies begin to implement new rules under the Dodd-Frank Act requiring banks to raise capital, curtail risk and rein in compensation. The Fed in March completed its most recent stress test, which it calls the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, and published its own test results for the 19 largest U.S. financial institutions.

Nomura Faces Regulatory Action on Insider Information Leaks
Nomura Holdings Inc. may face ¡°severe action¡± by Japanese regulators after employees of the country¡¯s biggest securities firm leaked insider information, Financial Services Minister Tadahiro Matsushita said.
Matsushita made the remarks at a news conference today in Tokyo. He didn¡¯t elaborate on the types of action the Financial Services Agency may take, saying it depends on the outcome of the investigation.
Nomura said last week that employees gave non-public information used for insider trading in 2010, acknowledging for the first time their role in cases being examined by regulators. The Securities Exchange and Surveillance Commission, the FSA¡¯s watchdog arm, has since March recommended penalizing the companies that profited from the tips while stopping short of punishing the underwriters who provided them.
The investigation centers on trading of shares of Japanese companies before they announced equity offerings in 2010. Employees at Nomura, a manager of stock sales by Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Inpex Corp. and Tokyo Electric Power Co., provided information on the stock sales.
Nomura repeated its regret over the leaks today. ¡°We continue to cooperate fully in the ongoing inspection by the commission,¡± the Tokyo-based bank said in a statement.
Merrill Singapore Unit Pays S$27,000 Monetary Authority Penalty
Bank of America Corp.¡¯s Merrill Lynch unit in Singapore paid a penalty of S$27,000 ($21,034 dollars) after 90 representatives conducted fund management activities before their names were entered in a public register, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said in a statement on its website dated yesterday.
The offenses occurred between November 2010 and August 2011, according to the authority.
Merrill Lynch has put policies in place to prevent a recurrence.

Defunct Swift Trade Appeals $12 Million FSA Market-Abuse Penalty
Defunct trading firm Swift Trade Inc. appealed a decision by the U.K. Financial Services Authority to fine it 8 million pounds ($12.4 million) for market abuse.
The company, which was dissolved in December 2010, appealed the penalty at a London tribunal yesterday and said that the fine was ¡°entirely disproportionate¡± to its activities.
Lawyers for Toronto-based Swift Trade said in written arguments said the penalty was ¡°fundamentally flawed from the outset¡± because the ¡°market-abuse legislation does not apply at all to ¡®synthetic product trading.¡¯¡±
Swift Trade was fined for engaging in ¡°layering,¡± in which multiple buy orders for shares are submitted and withdrawn to manipulate the price of a security, according to the judge.
The Ontario Securities Commission also found that Swift Trade breached securities laws by providing software and an electronic trading system for around 4,500 unregistered traders in 2008, according to a 2011 report.
Amgen Gets High Court Review of Class-Action Stock Fraud Suit
The U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether investors must prove that misinformation from Amgen Inc. propped up its stock price before they can pursue a class-action stock-fraud suit against the world¡¯s largest biotechnology company.
The justices yesterday agreed to review an appeal by Amgen in a case alleging the company and its executives misled investors for more than three years about safety questions involving its Aranesp and Epogen anemia drugs.
Amgen says a federal appeals court ruling makes it too easy to mount class-action lawsuits representing thousands of people, pressuring companies to pay settlements for even frivolous allegations rather than risk huge damages in a trial. Amgen¡¯s appeal is backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the pharmaceutical industry¡¯s trade group.
All sides agree that the investors alleging securities fraud must, at some point, show that misrepresentations by Amgen had an effect on its share price.
The company says judges should resolve disputes about the relevance of misleading information before letting multiple investors band together in a class-action suit.
The justices will hear arguments in the case during the term that begins in October.
The case is Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 11-1085.
Allergan Holders Can Proceed With Botox Suit, Judge Rules
Allergan Inc. investors can seek to hold directors responsible for criminal sanctions and a $600 million penalty that the maker of the wrinkle smoother Botox was ordered to pay for marketing the drug for unapproved uses, a judge ruled.
Two pension funds who contend that Allergan¡¯s board failed to properly oversee executives who marketed Botox for ailments that hadn¡¯t been approved by regulators have amassed enough evidence about the illegal sales effort to proceed with their claims, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster concluded yesterday.
The funds¡¯ allegations ¡°support a reasonable inference that the board consciously approved a business plan predicated on violating the federal statutory prohibition against off-label marketing,¡± Laster said in his 82-page ruling.
Botox, Allergan¡¯s best-selling product, had $1.59 billion in sales last year, about half for cosmetic uses and half for migraine treatment, incontinence and other conditions.
Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Allergan, declined to comment on Laster¡¯s ruling. ¡°At this point, we haven¡¯t fully reviewed the ruling,¡± she said in an e-mailed statement.
Allergan¡¯s marketing efforts have been the focus of scrutiny since 2007.
The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System and UFCW Local 1776 & Participating Employers Pension Fund v. Pyott, 5795, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Innospec Ex-CEO Jennings Pleads Guilty to U.K. Bribe Charges
Former Innospec Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Paul Jennings pleaded guilty yesterday to trying to bribe Indonesian and Iraqi government officials to win contracts.
Dennis Kerrison, another former CEO at the company, and Miltos Papachristos, the former regional sales director for the Asia-Pacific region at Innospec, both pleaded not guilty to a charge brought by the U.K.¡¯s Serious Fraud Office of attempting to bribe Indonesian officials to win contracts to supply the fuel additive tetraethyl lead. The pleas were entered at a hearing yesterday at a London criminal court and Kerrison and Papachristos will face trial next year.
Kerrison, of Surrey, England, was CEO of the company under its previous name, Octel Corp., according to the SFO. The charges cover a period from 2002 until 2008.
Innospec, a producer of fuel additives and specialty chemicals, agreed to pay more than $40 million in fines after pleading guilty in the U.K. and U.S. in 2010 to paying bribes overseas to secure sales contracts.

March 28 (Bloomberg) -- Ozon.ru, a Russian online shopping site similar to Amazon.com Inc., saw net sales by dollar value rise 55 percent last year.
Revenue reached $250 million in 2012 and the number of registered users increased to more than 14.5 million from 10.7 million, the company, which describes itself as ¡°the Amazon.com of Russia,¡± said in a statement today.
¡°Within the next five years when a Russian customer makes an online purchase the majority of them will be doing so through Ozon¡± or a related website, Chief Executive Officer Maelle Gavet said.
The company is looking into further acquisitions in e-commerce segments where it¡¯s not yet present, such as specialty online stores on the model of Amazon¡¯s diapers.com or soap.com, Gavet said this week in an interview in Moscow.
Initial public offerings by social network operator Mail.ru Group Ltd and search-engine provider Yandex NV ¡°spurred investor interest in the Russian Internet, leading to massive investments in e-commerce projects,¡± intensifying competition over the past two years, Gavet said.
Ozon also plans to expand in fashion and in attracting smaller stores to use the company¡¯s infrastructure, according to France-born Gavet. The Moscow-based company raised $100 million from investors in 2011 and used it to expand, buying online shoes-retailer Sapato.ru and building a warehouse in Tver.
Ozon¡¯s largest shareholder is Baring Vostok Capital Partners, which was also an early investor in Yandex.
Ozon began in 1998 by selling books online, then expanded into goods ranging from electronics to toys. Unlike Amazon, the unpredictability of the Russian postal service means Ozon has its own delivery service, O-Courier. And it offers travel services, selling airline tickets and hotels booking online.
Amazon, the world¡¯s largest Internet retailer, hasn¡¯t established a Russian-language site. Amazon bought online shoes-retailer Zappos.com in 2009.

88,"Ambitious Climate Limits Needed to Rescue UN Market, EU Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- The United Nations¡¯ carbon program, the world¡¯s second biggest, needs ¡°ambitious¡± emission-reduction targets to rescue a market that has shrunk by nearly 80 percent since 2007, according to the European Commission. Greenhouse gas credits dropped to a record.
More than 190 nations will discuss climate-protection rules for the period after 2012, when the current targets for developed nations under the Kyoto Protocol expire. Talks will take place in Durban, South Africa, starting Nov. 28. The European Union is open to the so-called second commitment period under certain conditions and hopes to have a new agreement binding all countries to cut emissions within five years, said Artur Runge-Metzger, the bloc¡¯s envoy to the talks.
¡°We¡¯re hopeful that countries within coming years will increase their level of ambitions and that would create additional demand for the Clean Development Mechanism,¡± Runge-Metzger said in an interview on Oct. 14. ¡°That¡¯s something we¡¯ll have to see. I wouldn¡¯t close the door.¡±
The UN Clean Development Mechanism, which generates credits for investment in emission-reduction projects in developing countries, shrank to $1.5 billion last year from $7.4 billion in 2007, according to World Bank estimates. Offset credits issued under the mechanism, known as the CDM, can be used for compliance by companies in the EU emissions trading system, valued at $119.8 billion in 2010 and ranked as the world¡¯s largest.
Least Developed Countries
From 2013 the EU will accept only new offset projects based in least-developed countries. Additionally, the import of credits generated by reducing industrial gas hydrofluorocarbon-23 and of those tied to some nitrous-oxide projects will be banned as of May 2013.
Supply from existing CDM projects, excluding activities related to HFC-23 and N2O, may be enough to satisfy demand from EU emitters by 2020, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data by the Risoe Centre on Energy, Climate & Sustainable Development. The Roskilde, Denmark-based Risoe is a unit of the UN Environment Program.
¡°In terms of calculations, if everything stays as it is, it seems that supply is sufficient to meet demand,¡± Runge-Metzger said. ¡°But we¡¯d hope that, like what we¡¯ve seen in Australia, which is planning to introduce emissions trading as of 2015, there may be more demand coming into the system. There could be several others.¡±
Australian Demand
Australia will add demand for 450 million metric tons of credits in the five years through 2020, Trevor Sikorski, an analyst for the investment banking unit of Barclays Plc, said today in an e-mailed research note. That¡¯s equivalent to about a quarter of yearly emissions in the EU market.
¡°With EU emissions-trading-system demand likely to become thinner in the period beyond 2016, then this could provide some much-needed demand for those international offsets,¡± Sikorski said.
Investors and traders including Geoff Sinclair, head of carbon trading at Standard Bank Group Ltd., have expressed concern that demand for the Certified Emission Reduction credits known as CERs will dry up without a global treaty with binding emission-reduction goals.
The UN talks to fix post-2012 climate architecture, which involve extending emission-reduction goals under the Kyoto accord and creating a new globally binding treaty, have stalled amid differences between rich and developing nations.
Countries including Japan and Russia have said they don¡¯t want to extend the Kyoto treaty. Their absence, along with that of the U.S., China and India, would leave the Kyoto pact without targets for the five biggest national emitters of pollution from burning fossil fuels.
Binding Targets
As part of the EU negotiating mandate for Durban, environment ministers agreed last week that the bloc would consider signing up for the second commitment period under Kyoto if the treaty guarantees environmental benefits and other nations determine a road map for a legally binding global deal.
¡°CER demand is really only driven by binding targets, and the only people providing that right now are the EU,¡± Sinclair said by e-mail. ¡°Investors need the demand side to be based on legally binding caps and anyone who genuinely believes anything different is on another planet.¡±
Mehran Massih, head of the environmental and climate change practice at Shearman & Sterling LLP in London, says the market is moving ¡°two steps forward and one step back.¡±
Back Up Needed
Demand stemming from new targets is needed to back up markets in California and Australia, he said by phone. ¡°While the grand, global plan may not happen the way people envisaged in 2008, smaller programs are getting off the ground,¡± Massih said. ¡°The engine continues to roll. Projects continue to be sponsored. The interest by big carbon funds and energy traders continues.¡±
UN offsets for delivery in December dropped as much as 1.9 percent to a record 7.12 euros ($9.80) a ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange and were at 7.13 euros as of 5:11 p.m. in London today.
¡°From December, all investment in CDM projects outside least-developed countries is likely to cease,¡± unless the EU reconsiders its rules, said Brett Jordaan, vice president of global carbon for the White Plains, New-York-based carbon and energy broker Evolution Markets Inc.

89,Arizona¡¯s Arpaio Testifies Race Not Factor in Arrests,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
July 25 (Bloomberg) -- Arizona¡¯s Joe Arpaio, the Maricopa County official who calls himself ¡°America¡¯s toughest sheriff,¡± said at a civil rights trial that his department doesn¡¯t arrest people ¡°because of the color of their skin.¡±
Arpaio, 80, testified yesterday in a federal court trial in Phoenix in which he and his deputies are accused of racially profiling Latinos. He was called as a witness by lawyers backed by the American Civil Liberties Union who represent all Latinos who have been stopped, detained, questioned or searched by Arpaio¡¯s deputies since January 2007. They are seeking a court ruling that the sheriff¡¯s so-called saturation patrols violated the group¡¯s constitutional rights.
Arpaio, dressed in a dark suit, said that prior to 2005, he didn¡¯t view illegal immigration as a ¡°serious legal issue.¡±
Stanley Young, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, showed Arpaio a sheriff¡¯s department document dated in 2005 in which he had written in the margin, ¡°Is it unreasonable to ask our police to question day laborers about their immigration status?¡±
Arpaio conceded that he wrote the question in the 2005 memo. He said he became more concerned about illegal immigration in 2006, the year the department created a hotline in which people could report suspected illegal aliens.
Traffic Laws
U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow in Phoenix will decide the case without a jury. The class-action lawsuit includes allegations similar to those made by the U.S. Justice Department in a suit filed in May against Arpaio, his office and the county. The U.S. accuses Arpaio of ¡°intentionally and systematically¡± discriminating against Latinos.
Arpaio has denied the allegations. His lawyers have said the traffic stops conducted by the saturation patrols weren¡¯t racially motivated and were prompted by the plaintiffs¡¯ violations of traffic laws.
Arpaio testified yesterday that he preferred the term crime suppression patrols rather than saturation patrols.
¡°We do not arrest people because of the color of their skin,¡± he said.
Young, who is with Covington & Burling LLP, asked the court to play a recording of a portion of a 2007 press conference in which Arpaio said ¡°you go after them and you lock them up,¡± referring to illegal aliens.
Office¡¯s ¡®Mission¡¯
Arpaio testified that though enforcing illegal immigration laws was part of the mission of the sheriff¡¯s office, ¡°we enforce all the laws, not just illegal immigration.¡±
The sheriff serves Arizona¡¯s biggest county by population, with 3.8 million residents. His methods, including the patrols in predominantly Latino areas in and around Phoenix, the state¡¯s largest city, have won him praise from groups seeking a crackdown on illegal entrants to the U.S. and made him a target of advocates for immigrants¡¯ rights.
The case began in 2007, when Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres, who was in the U.S. legally on a tourist visa, was detained by sheriff¡¯s deputies near a Cave Creek church where day laborers often gathered.
A driver had picked up Melendres and two other men and was driving away from the church when a deputy stopped the car for speeding. The driver, who was white, wasn¡¯t cited and was allowed to leave, while the Hispanic men were held. Melendres said in the lawsuit that a nine-hour detention that followed was unlawful.
Singled Out
¡°Three Mexicans in a vehicle and one Anglo driver,¡± Louis Moffa Jr., one of the lawyers who filed the original complaint in 2007, said in a phone interview. ¡°The Mexicans are arrested, the driver goes on his way. We see in other traffic stops that this was common.¡±
Melendres is one of the five named plaintiffs in the case. The other four are U.S. citizens.
David Rodriguez, of Mesa, Arizona, testified July 19 that in December 2007, while ¡°four-wheeling¡± with his family on a dirt road near Bartlett Dam, he inadvertently drove onto a closed road, as did several other vehicles.
Rodriguez said he was cited by a deputy, while the other drivers, all of whom Rodriguez described as white, weren¡¯t cited. Rodriguez said he believed he was cited because he is Hispanic.
Timothy Casey, an attorney for Arpaio and the sheriff¡¯s office who is with Schmitt Schneck Smyth Casey & Even in Phoenix, reminded Rodriguez during cross-examination that he had testified that he¡¯d driven more than 60,000 miles in Maricopa County since being stopped and hadn¡¯t once been pulled over by sheriff¡¯s deputies.
Opinion in Book
Young, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, asked Arpaio about a passage in his 2008 book, ¡°Joe¡¯s Law: America¡¯s Toughest Sheriff Takes on Illegal Immigration, Drugs and Everything Else That Threatens America.¡±
¡°You wrote, ¡®all other immigrants, exclusive of those from Mexico, held to certain hopes and truths,¡¯¡± Young said to Arpaio, asking him if he believes what he wrote.
Arpaio said that opinion is his co-author¡¯s, Len Sherman, and not his own. ¡°The people who come from Mexico have the same hopes as other people,¡± Arpaio testified.
Young read a 2007 statement to the press from Arpaio in which he said that although some people consider Queen Creek, Cave Creek and Wickenburg in the county to be ¡°sanctuaries¡± for large numbers of illegal day laborers who work in these towns, he thought ¡°the only sanctuary for illegal aliens is in Mexico.¡±
Day Laborers
In response to Young¡¯s questioning, Arpaio said he believed ¡°when people come into this country illegally and are deported they should stay in that country and not keep coming back into our country.¡±
When Young asked Arpaio about the likelihood that day laborers in those towns hadn¡¯t committed any crimes but were nevertheless detained by sheriff¡¯s deputies, Arpaio responded, ¡°We don¡¯t go grabbing people off street corners unless there is a crime committed,¡± adding that being in the country illegally is a crime.
Young questioned Arpaio about the many letters the sheriff had received from citizens complaining about neighbors the writers assumed were illegal aliens.
¡°Sheriff, have you ever written back to the letter writer and told them it is not a crime to be a minority?¡± Young asked. ¡°Have you said, ¡®I¡¯m not going to go after people based on their race or ethnicity?¡¯¡±
Arpaio responded, ¡°I might have. I don¡¯t remember.¡±
The plaintiffs are asking for a federally appointed monitor to be put in place in the sheriff¡¯s office to ensure racial profiling doesn¡¯t take place.
The case is Melendres v. Arpaio, 07-02513, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix).

91,¡®American Idol¡¯ Audience Shrinks 12% in Season Opener,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Jan. 20 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°American Idol¡± averaged 26.2 million viewers in the two-hour opening of its 10th season on News Corp.¡¯s Fox TV, the show¡¯s second-smallest first night audience and a threat to the network¡¯s ratings dominance.
The audience shrank 12 percent from the 29.9 million who watched last year¡¯s debut, according to updated Nielsen Co. data released today by Los Angeles-based Fox. The 18-to-49-year-old viewers, a group prized by advertisers, fell 18 percent.
The series, most-watched in the U.S. for seven straight seasons, has been the biggest contributor to Fox¡¯s six-year lead in 18-to-49-year-olds and was retooled this year with new judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler. Halfway through this TV season, ¡°NBC Sunday Night Football¡± leads in total and younger viewers, according to Nielsen data, while CBS is the most-watched network among all viewers and the target group.
¡°We knew this day was coming,¡± David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York, said in an interview. ¡°Without Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul, we figured ratings would slip.¡±
In the past six seasons, the large audience for ¡°Idol,¡± which starts in January, has carried Fox to victory in the target younger audience. Ratings for the night highlight the importance of the series, which attracted two to three times the number of viewers as competing programs, Nielsen data show.
Fox will broadcast the Super Bowl on Feb. 6. The annual NFL championship game attracts the largest TV audience of the year and will give the network a ratings boost that lifts its season-ending tally.
New York Hopefuls
Last night¡¯s episode featured hopefuls in the New York suburb of Jersey City, New Jersey. Singers tapped by judges to advance will travel to Los Angeles for the next round. In tonight¡¯s show, judges screen tryouts in New Orleans.
¡°Idol¡± is airing on different nights this year and added the new judges after Simon Cowell departed for Fox¡¯s ¡°X-Factor¡± competition show, which starts in September.
The ratings last night marked the biggest drop for an ¡°Idol¡± season opener. The first season debut had the lowest audience at 9.85 million viewers, followed by season two at 26.5 million in 2003, Nielsen data show.
Producers FremantleMedia North America Inc. and 19 Entertainment, part of New York-based CKX Inc., brought on Universal Music Group for the new season and renewed the show¡¯s focus on music. Jimmy Iovine, founder of Universal¡¯s Interscope Records, will coach contestants on the air.
News Corp., controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch, rose 43 cents to $14.66 as of 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares gained 6.4 percent in 2010 compared with a 13 percent increase in the Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index.
Ad Rates
¡°Idol¡¯s¡± ninth season, where voters crowned Lee DeWyze the winner last May, dropped 9 percent in total and younger viewers. A 30-second commercial during the show costs an average $485,000, more than the $445,000 garnered by NBC¡¯s Sunday football, Ad Age reported in October. Fox expected fewer viewers last night and priced advertising accordingly, Bank said.
¡°They anticipated some of this,¡± Bank said. ¡°The ratings guaranteed to advertisers probably incorporated the decline.¡±
Fox is averaging 7.73 million viewers a night this season, lowest of the major U.S. broadcast networks, and is drawing 3.66 million viewers ages 18 to 49, second to CBS Corp.¡¯s TV network.

93,¡®American Idol¡¯ Owner CKX Ends Talks to Sell Company,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- CKX Inc., owner of the ¡°American Idol¡± television show, said it ended discussions to sell the company or a controlling stake, seven months after the talks were first acknowledged.
The board said proposals received from a number of parties weren¡¯t in the best interest of shareholders, New York-based CKX said today in a statement, without identifying the bidders.
CKX said in late March that it was in discussions about a possible sale. JPMorgan Chase & Co.¡¯s One Equity Partners private-equity arm was near an agreement to take the company private, a person with knowledge of the talks said at that time. Bids later emerged from CKX founder Robert F.X. Sillerman, who stepped down as chief executive in May to pursue a controlling stake, and from a separate investor group led by Simon Fuller, the creator of the ¡°Idol¡± series.
Investors had been pursuing CKX as its No. 1 U.S. TV show franchise began to falter with a 9 percent ratings drop last season. ¡°Idol,¡± which airs on News Corp.¡¯s Fox broadcast network, is undergoing a makeover ahead of the 10th season with new judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler and the return of executive producer Nigel Lythgoe.
This marks the second set of failed sale talks in the last three years. Fuller and Sillerman tried to take the company private together in 2007, dropping the $12-a-share bid in 2008.
As recently as August, Sillerman said he was preparing a cash offer of $5.50 to $5.75 a share for a majority stake in CKX. The proposal called for Sillerman, CKX¡¯s biggest investor with 21 percent of the stock, to return as executive chairman.
Fuller Bid
Since then the shares have fallen 20 percent, giving CKX a market capitalization of about $401 million, based on Bloomberg data. CKX fell 6 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $4.31 today in Nasdaq Stock Market trading before the termination of the sale discussions was announced.
CKX received a $600 million bid from Fuller, a person familiar with the offer said in May. It valued the company at about $6.45 a share.
CKX owns two-thirds of the ¡°Idol¡± brand and co-produces the show in the U.S. with Fremantle Media, owner of the other third, according to the company¡¯s annual report. CKX¡¯s 19 Entertainment has a global television and production agreement with Fremantle.

94,Gores Group Said to Make Unsolicited Bid for ¡®Idol¡¯s¡¯ CKX,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 1 (Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Alec Gores made an unsolicited offer for ¡°American Idol¡± owner CKX Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the bid.
The offer came in a March 23 letter from Los Angeles-based Gores Group and was at a premium to CKX¡¯s trading price at the time, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the proposal isn¡¯t public. The person declined to give a specific price. At yesterday¡¯s closing price, CKX had a market value of about $392 million.
The Gores bid comes five months after CKX ended discussions to sell the company or a controlling stake. The company held talks last year with JPMorgan Chase & Co.¡¯s One Equity Partners, a person close to the situation said at the time. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Sillerman resigned in May to separately pursue a possible purchase of CKX.
CKX surged 43 cents, or 10 percent, to $4.65 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained 15 percent this year.
CKX referred inquiries to an outside spokesman, William Schmitt, who didn¡¯t immediately respond to a request for comment. Michael Sitrick, a spokesman for Gores, declined to comment.
Gores Group raised $2 billion in February for acquisitions, including in the consumer sector. With his brother Tom, Alec Gores made an unsuccessful bid for the Miramax film studio. Tom Gores runs Beverly Hills, California-based buyout firm Platinum Equity LLC.
CKX owns two-thirds of the ¡°Idol¡± brand and co-produces the show in the U.S. with Fremantle Media, owner of the rest, according to the company¡¯s annual report. CKX¡¯s 19 Entertainment has a global television and production agreement with Fremantle. In 2005 CKX bought 19 Entertainment, which was founded by Simon Fuller, the creator of the ¡°Idol¡± series.

95,CKX Says Sillerman Takeover Talks May Occur in Days,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Â Â Â Â May 11 (Bloomberg) -- CKX Inc., the owner of ¡°American Idol,¡± said there may soon be discussions about founder Robert F.X. Sillerman¡¯s possible plan to take the entertainment company private.
Sillerman, CKX¡¯s largest shareholder, resigned as chairman and chief executive officer last week to explore a takeover, and to let the board evaluate other options. New York-based CKX disclosed March 29 that it was in talks on a possible sale.
¡°There is a party that we have been in active dialogue on in the past month that triggered the announcement we made a month ago,¡± CKX Chief Financial Officer Thomas Benson said today on a conference call, without identifying the party.. ¡°Separately and apart from that, Bob has now expressed a stated interest in taking the company private as well.¡±
This would be Sillerman¡¯s second attempt to go private with CKX, formed five years ago through a combination with Simon Fuller¡¯s 19 Entertainment. The company was close to an agreement in March with JPMorgan Chase & Co.¡¯s private-equity arm to take CKX private, a person familiar with the situation said then.
CKX, which also owns the rights to the names and images of Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali, fell 22 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $5.54 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, giving the company a market value of $515.6 million.
After U.S. markets closed yesterday, CKX reported a first-quarter loss of $5.03 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with profit of $12.1 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier. The company recorded $4.85 million in costs tied to a rental property at Graceland and wrote down the value of businesses being closed within 19 Entertainment.
CKX¡¯s Origins
The company was formed in March 2005 when Sports Enterprises acquired 19 Entertainment for about $161.3 million. Fuller, the founder of 19 Entertainment, created the ¡°Idol¡± concept and imported it from the U.K. Fuller left the company this year and is now a consultant for CKX.
CKX owns two-thirds of the ¡°Idols¡± brand and co-produces the show in the U.S. with Bertelsmann AG¡¯s Fremantle Media, owner of the other third, according to the company¡¯s annual report. CKX¡¯s 19 Entertainment has a global television and production agreement with Fremantle.

96,¡®American Idol¡¯ to End After 15 Seasons as Fox Pulls Plug,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
¡°American Idol,¡± the popular singing show that started the career of music stars and ushered in a slew of copycats, will end its run on Fox after its 15th season concludes in 2016.
The network said Monday this upcoming season would be Idol¡¯s last, pulling the plug on a show that turned contestants, judges and its host, Ryan Seacrest, into global celebrities.
The show has been an anchor on Fox¡¯s schedule since its debut in 2002, drawing more than 30 million viewers in some seasons and more than 20 million for much of its existence. Though the audience has dwindled in recent years, the show remains one of Fox¡¯s most-watched programs, and its end signals a programming reboot by Fox¡¯s new leaders, Dana Walden and Gary Newman.
¡°It was not an easy decision,¡± Newman, co-chairman of Fox Television, said on a call with reporters. ¡°¡®American Idol¡¯ has been such a vital part of Fox throughout its run. We spent a lot of time talking with the producers about the future of ¡®American Idol,¡¯ and collectively we all arrived at the conclusion that it was time to bring the show to an end.¡±
To enliven a network whose ratings dropped more than 20 percent this past season, Walden and Newman are banking on Fox¡¯s new music show, the hip-hop drama ¡°Empire,¡± to be a linchpin of the network¡¯s success, alongside the return of ¡°The X-Files¡± and a series by Ryan Murphy, the creator of ¡°Glee.¡± Murphy¡¯s ¡°Scream Queens,¡± a horror anthology show that will debut on Fox in the upcoming season.
The last season of ¡°Idol¡± will feature host Seacrest with judges Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick Jr. Newman and Walden promised a celebratory final season full of surprises, including potential visits from past judges, like Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul, or winners such as Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood.
Though ¡°Idol¡± has surrendered its throne to NBC¡¯s ¡°The Voice,¡± a show where the hosts are the biggest celebrities, Newman and Walden left the door open to future singing competition shows. Even with a complete overhaul of the judges-table and a steady decline in the ratings, ¡°Idol¡± began its most recent season with more than 11 million viewers.
Fox announced the show¡¯s ending ahead of its Upfront advertising presentation in New York. The four big broadcasters -- also including ABC, NBC and CBS -- will raise $8.61 billion in Upfront ad commitments, a 3.1 percent rise, according to estimates from Nomura Securities International Inc."
97,¡®Idol¡¯ Viewers Vote Lee DeWyze Winner of Ninth Season,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lee DeWyze, a 24-year-old guitar and piano player, was crowned ninth season winner of Fox¡¯s ¡°American Idol,¡± the most-watched U.S. television show.
The musician from Mount Prospect, Illinois, beat 24-year-old Crystal Bowersox of Elliston, Ohio, by winning the majority of viewers¡¯ votes, host Ryan Seacrest announced at the end of tonight¡¯s two-hour show, broadcast live on the U.S. East Coast. Both contestants auditioned in Chicago. Less than 2 percent of the votes separated them, he said.
¡°I¡¯ve never been happier in my life,¡± DeWyze said. ¡°There¡¯s no words to describe it. It¡¯s just amazing.¡±
DeWyze, who worked in a paint shop before auditioning, captivated audiences with his rendition of ¡°Hallelujah¡± and sang ¡°The Boxer¡± and ¡°Beautiful Day¡± during the final Tuesday night show to win the ¡°Idol¡± crown. ¡°Idol¡± also bid farewell to Simon Cowell, one of the original judges, who is stepping down at a time when the show¡¯s ratings are dropping.
¡°I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the support, the fun and your sense of humor,¡± Cowell told the audience and viewers. ¡°The truth is you¡¯re the judge of this show and you¡¯ve done an incredible job.¡±
The sharp-tongued judge is expected to return to News Corp.¡¯s Fox network late next year with a new music competition show called ¡°The X Factor,¡± which he created in the U.K.
Ratings for ¡°Idol¡± will be down about 9 percent this season, which is ¡°pretty good¡± compared with other TV shows, Fox Entertainment Chairman Peter Rice said on a May 17 conference call.
News Corp., based in New York, rose 5 cents to $12.86 today in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The Class A shares have dropped 6.1 percent this year.

May 27 (Bloomberg) -- Lee DeWyze, a 24-year-old guitar and piano player, was crowned ninth-season winner of Fox¡¯s ¡°American Idol,¡± the most-watched U.S. television show.
The musician from Mount Prospect, Illinois, beat 24-year-old Crystal Bowersox of Elliston, Ohio, by winning the majority of viewers¡¯ votes, host Ryan Seacrest said at the end of last night¡¯s two-hour finale. Both contestants auditioned in Chicago. Less than 2 percent of the votes separated them, he said.
¡°I¡¯ve never been happier in my life,¡± DeWyze said. ¡°There¡¯s no words to describe it. It¡¯s just amazing.¡±
DeWyze, who worked in a paint shop before auditioning, captivated audiences with his rendition of ¡°Hallelujah¡± and sang ¡°The Boxer¡± and ¡°Beautiful Day¡± on May 25, the first half of a two-night finale, to win the crown. ¡°Idol¡± also bid farewell to Simon Cowell, one of the original judges, who is stepping down at a time when the show¡¯s ratings are dropping.
¡°I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the support, the fun and your sense of humor,¡± Cowell told the audience and viewers. ¡°The truth is you¡¯re the judge of this show and you¡¯ve done an incredible job.¡±
Cowell, known for his sharp tongue, is expected to return to News Corp.¡¯s Fox network late next year with a new music competition show called ¡°The X Factor,¡± which he created in the U.K.
The ¡°Idol¡± season finale averaged 23.2 million viewers, excluding adjustments to reflect additional time when the show ran long, Fox said today in an e-mailed statement, citing preliminary Nielsen Co. data. With the added time, the show attracted an average of 24.2 million, a 16 percent drop from the previous season¡¯s finale, according to Nielsen data.
Season¡¯s Ratings
Ratings for ¡°Idol¡± will be down about 9 percent this season, which is ¡°pretty good¡± compared with other TV shows, Fox Entertainment Chairman Peter Rice said on a May 17 conference call. ¡°Idol¡± has remained the most-watched prime-time program for seven straight years, according to Fox.
Fox said separately today it attracted the most prime-time viewers ages 18 to 49, the group favored by advertisers, in the TV season that ends this week.
News Corp., based in New York, rose 63 cents to $13.49 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The Class A shares have declined 1.5 percent this year.
Fox will be looking for Cowell¡¯s replacement this summer, Rice said on the call. Cowell is the second judge to leave in as many years. Paula Abdul didn¡¯t return this season and was replaced by comedian Ellen DeGeneres.

99,Amish Life in Tokyo Will Cause Economic Backlash: William Pesek,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 29 (Bloomberg) -- What¡¯s up with the blue jackets?
This is suddenly THE question I¡¯m getting when speaking with folks overseas or reading my e-mails. It¡¯s not whether I feel safe, or if I¡¯m drinking Tokyo¡¯s radioactive tap water or if I plan to make a beeline out of the Fukushima zone. It¡¯s why, oh why, are Japanese leaders dressed like auto mechanics?
It¡¯s to show, of course, they are in full-blown crisis-management mode. We¡¯re engaged, we¡¯re on the ground and we¡¯re working hard. Barack Obama in Washington and David Cameron in London roll up their sleeves to indicate they¡¯re getting their hands dirty. In Tokyo, Naoto Kan gets into blue crisis gear.
The trouble is, this powerful photo-op image isn¡¯t being matched by substance or action. There¡¯s a very valid reason why Kan¡¯s approval rating is a wretched 28 percent: His timidity in the face of Japan¡¯s worst crisis since World War II.
Nowhere is that more apparent than the kid gloves with which he continues to treat Tokyo Electric Power Co. It should have been nationalized 10 days ago and its entire corporate board fired for incompetence and negligence. Each day that passes with Tepco¡¯s leaky nuclear facilities wreaking havoc with the third largest economy further damages Kan¡¯s standing.
Kan has been neither a complete disaster nor inspirer-in-chief for his traumatized nation of 127 million. He¡¯s been something else -- largely irrelevant. That can be seen in a joke making the rounds: U.S. President Obama wants to speak with Japan¡¯s leader about the nuclear crisis. When Kan answers, Obama asked to speak to his spokesman, Yukio Edano.
Vague Platitudes
That Edano has been more visible than Kan during this crisis -- wearing, of course, a blue crisis jacket -- has only heightened the sense that no one is in firm control. Dressing up like a gas-station attendant, doing helicopter fly-bys and addressing the nation with vague platitudes only buttresses the sense that Kan doesn¡¯t get it. Kan has time to turn things around. The question is, can he?
Teetering in the balance is Japan¡¯s economy. It¡¯s amazing that a week ago economists were still arguing Japan would avoid recession. Their mistake was applying conventional thinking to a wildly unconventional scenario. Hyper-modern, neon-sign-crazy Tokyo is now Asia¡¯s answer to Amish country.
Corporate Japan has long been famous not only for its own innovations, but for taking ideas from abroad, improving upon them and making them its own. The Amish, meanwhile, are known for simple living and an aversion to many conveniences of modern technology -- like electricity. I never expected to experience that in gizmo-obsessed Tokyo.
Fallout Continues
The fallout from the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and still unfolding nuclear crisis is ushering in an age of self-restraint in a city known for consumerism. Not only are normally bustling Prada, Tiffany and Hermes shops empty -- when they¡¯re not closed to save energy -- so are higher-end eateries.
Walking around Tokyo is quite an experience. While the place certainly isn¡¯t a ghost town, it¡¯s eerily quiet. It¡¯s a good thing Tokyo is reasonably crime free. Otherwise, the fact that shops are only turning on a few lights and operating darkly would make the place a shoplifter¡¯s paradise. Many elevators, escalators, heaters and televisions used for advertisements are off. So are other creature-comforts like toilet-seat warmers.
Many pachinko parlors that operate with a jamboree of buzzers, bells and whistles that flows loudly into the street are sound-free. The emptiness of the shelves at the city¡¯s ubiquitous 24-hour convenience stores smacks more of Moscow, circa 1986, than Tokyo in 2011. Karaoke clubs are closing early, baseball games are being shifted to daytime and even Tokyo¡¯s fabled cherry-blossom-viewing parties are being scaled back.
Got Toilet Paper?
Rolling blackouts have created a bull market for LED lamps and flashlights. Suddenly, department stores regret not having bigger camping-equipment sections. Really, who knew? Tokyoites are hoarding bottles of water and toilet paper is frustratingly scarce. My local reggae bar owner told me he¡¯s stopped placing extra rolls in the bathroom. His patrons are stealing them.
And then there are the more headline-grabbing disruptions. Plants run by the likes of Asahi Breweries Ltd., Fuji Heavy Ltd., Meiji Holdings Co., Nikon Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. have been shuttered. Tourists are canceling spring trips to Japan. Many of the foreigners who fled Tokyo have yet to return.
So, economists out there: Still think Japan will experience positive growth this year? That rebuilding efforts in the northeast will be enough to overcome the extent to which Tokyoites and their employers are living the modern-day equivalent of a late 19th century existence? I sure don¡¯t.
Self-Restraint
Japan wants consumers to spend more and save less. Yet the way Kan¡¯s government has handled this crisis is further dimming economic confidence. Two weeks ago, Kan should have declared a national emergency and, at a minimum, nationalized Tepco (only now is the government mulling just that).
Instead, the message has been of the ¡°life goes on¡± variety. Well, Tokyoites, with our voluntary self-restraint, are saying that¡¯s obviously not the case. Life here is changing markedly, and neither the economy nor the political scene will ever be the same. Someone should tell the prime minister.

100,¡®Amour¡¯ by Haneke Wins Cannes Festival¡¯s Palme D¡¯Or Award,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 28 (Bloomberg) -- The Cannes Film Festival ended last night with a victory for ¡°Love¡± (¡°Amour¡±) by Michael Haneke, the story of an elderly woman who suffers a debilitating stroke and is looked after by her devoted husband.
It was the second Palme d¡¯Or for Austria¡¯s Haneke, who won in 2009 for ¡°The White Ribbon.¡± He joins a list of only a half-dozen other two-time winners including Francis Ford Coppola.
During the televised awards ceremony, Haneke invited his two lead actors -- Jean-Louis Trintignant (star of the 1966 ¡°A Man and a Woman¡±) and Emmanuelle Riva (who was in the 1959 ¡°Hiroshima My Love¡±) -- on stage. In the movie, she makes him promise never to take her back to the hospital.
¡°I thank my wife, who has been putting up with me for 30 years,¡± said the white-haired, white-bearded Haneke. ¡°This film is an illustration of the promise we made to each other in case one of us was to experience a situation like the one in the film.¡±
Though there were five U.S. contenders out of the 22 vying for the Palme d¡¯Or, none of them won anything. All but one of the awards went to European movies.
The runner-up Grand Prix was garnered by ¡°Reality,¡± directed by Italy¡¯s Matteo Garrone, about a Naples fishmonger who becomes obsessed with a reality show he auditions for. The film¡¯s lead actor, Aniello Arena, is a prisoner in real life, and part of a theater troupe.
Angels¡¯ Share
The Jury Prize went to the U.K.¡¯s Ken Loach (winner of the 2006 Palme d¡¯Or with ¡°The Wind That Shakes the Barley¡±). His 2012 ¡°The Angels¡¯ Share¡± is a feel-good film about a young offender who lifts himself out of delinquency by discovering a vocation in aged whiskey.
Steering this year¡¯s nine-person jury was Italian director Nanni Moretti (¡°Dear Diary¡±). His panelists included actor Ewan McGregor and couturier Jean-Paul Gaultier, who turned up to the awards ceremony in an ankle-length skirt with a slit.
Their Palme d¡¯Or pick, ¡°Amour,¡± opens with the eighty-something lovebirds, both retired music teachers, attending a piano recital in Paris. When they return home, he helps her out of her coat, and compliments her on her beauty.
The next morning, they sit down to breakfast in their dressing gowns and talk about stepping out to buy the pianist¡¯s CD. Suddenly Anne blanks out: Her eyes are wide open, but she seems unable to see or hear anything, and doesn¡¯t react to the faucet that he leaves running in a panic.
By the next scene, Anne is back from hospital and paralyzed on one side. She has suffered a stroke, and a post-stroke operation has backfired. She makes Georges promise to keep her home.
Dance Embrace
Georges becomes her full-time carer, cutting up her food into little mouthfuls, brushing her hair and helping her do her leg exercises. As he lifts her out of her wheelchair in one scene, they embrace in a touchingly still dance.
Haneke films every scene like life itself, virtually in real time. The only interruptions occur during visits from their neurotic daughter (Isabelle Huppert), who discusses her husband and real-estate investments, and when the cleaner vacuums.
Beautiful yet harrowing to watch, ¡°Amour¡± is a rare instance of a movie camera settling on elderly, wrinkled faces. Haneke is unsparing yet affectionate in his handling of the subject matter.
Cannes this year featured the worst weather in recent memory. It rained for much of the festival, including for the closing-night ceremony, forcing participants to go around, unusually, carrying umbrellas.
Pitt, Kidman
There were plenty of Hollywood stars gracing the red carpet, including Brad Pitt, Nicole Kidman, Bruce Willis and Matthew McConaughey. Kylie Minogue, who had a cameo in the weird French movie ¡°Holy Motors¡± (by Leos Carax), got photographers working overtime. So did Robert Pattinson, the ¡°Twilight¡± actor who starred in ¡°Cosmopolis¡± by David Cronenberg.
It was a breakthrough festival for a string of talented male actors in tough-guy parts. Matthias Schoenaerts played a bouncer-boxer who meets a killer-whale trainer in ¡°Rust & Bone¡± starring Marion Cotillard.
Tom Hardy was excellent as the fearless Virginia bootlegger in ¡°Lawless¡± with Shia LaBeouf. And Garrett Hedlund stood out in Walter Salles¡¯s otherwise lackluster adaptation of Jack Kerouac¡¯s classic coming-of-age novel ¡°On the Road.¡±
The best-actor prize evaded them all. It went to Mads Mikkelsen for the Danish movie ¡°The Hunt,¡± directed by Thomas Vinterberg, the story of a teacher wrongly accused of pedophilia.
The Romanian title ¡°Beyond the Hills,¡± directed by Cristian Mungiu, took the best-script award, while its two leads Cristina Flutur and Cosmina Stratan shared the best-actress honor.
This year¡¯s festival was the 65th of its kind. The first one took place in 1946, a year after World War II ended. Among the event¡¯s earliest award winners were directors Orson Welles, Luis Bunuel, Ingmar Bergman and Satyajit Ray.

101,¡®An American in Paris¡¯ Owes Its Broadway Success to a Frenchman,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
For Jean-Luc Choplin, it is fitting that the Tony-awards winning Broadway hit ¡°An American in Paris¡± was made in France.
The 64-year-old award-winning director of the Chatelet Theater in Paris last year produced the musical -- in English with French subtitles -- with a view to eventually taking the theater version of Vincente Minnelli¡¯s 1951 feel-good movie to the Big Apple. Choplin¡¯s plan has paid off, bringing with it the promise of future projects.
¡°It makes me happy that a show created here is re-boosting Broadway¡¯s pride,¡± Choplin said during an interview in his Parisian office overlooking the Seine river.
The play about a young American soldier, Jerry Mulligan, played by Gene Kelly in the film, falling in love with a French girl, Lise Bouvier, in a much-romanticized Paris just after World War II has been running in New York¡¯s Palace Theater since March. It garnered four Tony Awards this month and was the fifth most sold show on Broadway last week, fetching $1.44 million since it opened there.
For Choplin, the play¡¯s success is a vindication of his efforts to hoist Paris onto the musical theater scene dominated by New York and London. The City of Light, better known for its bare-breasted cancan-dancing sound-and-light cabarets staged by the Moulin Rouge or the Lido, can get a bigger piece of the theater pie with shows of ¡°exceptional quality,¡± Choplin says.
Of the ¡°American in Paris,¡± reviewer Nancy Salz wrote in New York Arts on April 13, ¡°It could have been created during the Golden Age of Broadway, so seamlessly integrated is the extraordinary, ballet-driven musical.¡±
Business Savvy
In his 10 years at the helm of the Parisian venue, Choplin has produced more than 20 musicals, overcoming French audiences¡¯ traditional indifference to the American art form. Along with classics such as ¡°My Fair Lady,¡± ¡°West Side Story,¡± ¡°Singin¡¯ in the Rain¡± and ¡°The Sound of Music,¡± he has produced musical theater icon Stephen J. Sondheim¡¯s plays ¡°Sweeney Todd¡± and ¡°A Little Night Music.¡±
A former Walt Disney employee, Choplin routinely cites Michael Eisner as one of the people who¡¯ve influenced him. The theater man, who hails from Anjou, in northwestern France, has degrees in economics and music and has always been associated with the arts, including as the general administrator of dance at the Ballet de l¡¯Opera de Paris, working with Rudolf Nureyev.
To his current role, he has brought a rare mix of artistic sensibility and business savvy. He sold his production of ¡°Sweeney Todd¡± to the Houston Grand Opera and the Chicago Opera. The latter also took his ¡°My Fair Lady¡± and ¡°The King and I.¡±
New Recipe
With ¡°An American in Paris,¡± Choplin says he has found a new recipe for investment.
The Chatelet footed only half the bill. Following the Gershwin¡¯s family¡¯s advice, Choplin teamed with U.S. producers. The Americans funded a part of the rights, booklets, rehearsals and artists¡¯ contracts, while the scenery, costumes and props were on Paris. A four million-euro ($4.47 million) investment was paid off in 40 full houses. Further royalties are pure profit.
The play won Tony awards for choreography, lighting and scenic design as well as orchestration.
¡°Before An American, no one even thought about Paris, it was considered a place where musicals didn¡¯t exist and could have no success,¡± Choplin said.
He¡¯s now in talks with Broadway producers on another big project that he declined to elaborate on. His dream is for a U.S. success for his next creations, ¡®¡¯Passion¡¯¡¯ -- one of Sondheim¡¯s less known works -- and ¡®¡¯Carmencita¡¯¡¯ -- a Cuban version of Bizet¡¯s opera.
For Choplin, that would ensure Chatelet a ¡°happily ever after¡± life like the endings of some of his productions."

April 7 (Bloomberg) -- Almost a year after New York¡¯s Public Theater first presented ¡°Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson: The Concert Version,¡± this raucous, engaging musical about the seventh U.S. president returns, 10 minutes trimmer but visually expanded for a bigger space.
Set mostly in Jackson¡¯s 19th-century South, it¡¯s nonetheless a show of such immediacy that no one will mistake it for a dry history lesson. With themes of Manifest Destiny, genocide, inside-the-Beltway politicking and fevered populism, it¡¯s a show of and for our times.
¡°Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson¡± spins the tale of young man whose parents were killed by Indians. Jackson would come to epitomize American expansionism. He hated the Northeast establishment, ¡°King¡± George Washington, bankers run rampant and, most of all, the Indian tribes slowing the young country¡¯s inevitable progress.
¡°I¡¯m the will of the People and I alone know what¡¯s right!¡± Jackson (Benjamin Walker, in an appealing performance that recalls the young Bill Murray) tells his former Indian ally. ¡°I wish you¡¯d built symphonies, in cities, man, and put on plays and showed yourselves to be a little more essential. You know, to the culture?¡±
History as Metaphor
Alex Timbers¡¯s script (he also directed) pays no heed to linear time; funny-smart and funny-dumb references to Foucault, Sontag and de Tocqueville abound. The songs, by Michael Friedman, wink as knowingly to Elvis as to the purposefully self-conscious genre of emo rock.
Donyale Werle¡¯s scarlet set spills beyond the proscenium with crystal chandeliers, red lights, plentiful taxidermy, ropes, gilt-framed portraits, you name it -- turning the Newman Theater into a Victorian toy theater as designed for ¡°The Twilight Zone.¡± The exemplary actors, members of Les Freres Corbusier, are outfitted in a mishmash of styles, all of them parodies, by Emily Rebholz, and the music is played by a gifted rock trio augmented by company members.
Timbers, along with music director Justin Levine and choreographer Danny Mefford, have assembled a rare thing: a rousing historical spectacle of eerie prescience.

103,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ May Slingshot Into Starbucks in Retail Expansion,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 20 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Angry Birds¡± game creator Rovio Entertainment Oy is working on alliances with Starbucks Corp. and other retailers to reach new customers and sell a wider range of products.
Rovio, whose smartphone game has been downloaded more than 350 million times, is in discussions with Starbucks about in-store promotions, Wibe Wagemans, a senior vice president at the Espoo, Finland-based company, said in an interview. Rovio may offer virtual goods and set up electronic leader boards in stores to tout top-scoring ¡°Angry Birds¡± players.
The company is trying to convert its digital success into a real-world empire by selling ¡°Angry Birds¡± books, stuffed animals, T-shirts and other gear. Rovio also is planning a movie version of the game. It¡¯s part of an effort to diversify sales and attract more customers ahead of an initial public offering, which the company says may take place within the next few years.
¡°It¡¯s tying in the real world with the virtual world,¡± Wagemans said. ¡°Retailers get new customers who¡¯ve not been to their stores yet, and repeat customers.¡±
Having leader boards encourages customers to play ¡°Angry Birds¡± on their devices at the store, so they can see their scores spotlighted, he said. The game involves using a slingshot to fire birds at enemy pigs, who build increasingly elaborate fortifications.
Starbucks Partnership
Starbucks, the world¡¯s biggest operator of coffee shops, declined to comment on any talks with Rovio.
¡°While we are always looking for great partnerships to better meet the needs of our customers, at this time we have no announcements regarding any work with Rovio Entertainment,¡± the Seattle-based company said in an e-mailed statement.
Rovio is expanding into new areas as the market for mobile and social-networking games intensifies. While ¡°Angry Birds¡± is one of the best-selling applications for smartphones and tablets, new competitors emerge daily. Among paid apps, ¡°Angry Birds¡± has been bumped from the top of the U.S. iPhone download charts by Firemint Pty Ltd.¡¯s ¡°Spy Mouse.¡±
Rovio, which offers merchandise on its website, already sells 1 million stuffed animals a month, Wagemans said. He declined to discuss financial results. The company raised $42 million in funding in March, and has held talks about another investment that would value Rovio at about $1.2 billion, people familiar with the matter said last month.
Barnes & Noble
Rovio began running ¡°Angry Birds¡± leader-board promotions at Barnes & Noble Inc.¡¯s U.S. locations this year. It also sells merchandise through the bookstore chain, as well as Toys ¡°R¡± Us Inc.
¡°Angry Birds¡± is now seeking to crack the market for social-networking games, where Zynga Inc. dominates. Rovio has a game for the Google+ service, and a version for Facebook Inc. is in the works, Wagemans said.
Getting the game on Facebook could shake up the market, said Elizabeth Shaw, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a research firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
¡°I¡¯d definitely predict a big splash,¡± Shaw said. ¡°It would definitely rev up competition.¡±
Rovio has versions of the game for personal computers and the Roku streaming service, and it¡¯s looking to bring it to more television-connected devices, Wagemans said.
Users of Barnes & Noble¡¯s Nook e-book readers who stop by the bookstores can get a free virtual item -- a Mighty Eagle. The bird, which normally costs 99 cents, appears in the game and helps players advance to the next level.
Tens of thousands of people have received Mighty Eagles in stores, Wagemans said. And more than 10,000 people have spent more than 30 minutes playing at Barnes & Noble locations, boosting the stores¡¯ foot traffic, he said.
¡°There are retailers out there who have a lot to gain by increasing the time spent at their location, and increasing the money spent there,¡± Wagemans said.

104,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ Maker to Open First Stores in China This Year,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Rovio Entertainment Oy, the creator of the ¡°Angry Birds¡± mobile-phone games, will open its first retail stores this year in China, its fastest-growing market.
The company aims to hit $100 million in retail sales in China in the first year of store operations, Chief Marketing Officer Peter Vesterbacka said at the Techcrunch conference in Beijing today. He didn¡¯t provide possible locations or say how many outlets the Espoo, Finland-based company plans to open.
¡°Angry Birds¡± has multiple game versions in which players use a virtual slingshot to fire birds at structures populated by green pigs. Rovio currently sells merchandise including stuffed toys, flip-flops and Halloween costumes through its online store.
¡°China is our fastest-growing market, so we are taking it very seriously,¡± Vesterbacka said. ¡°We want to be more Chinese than the Chinese companies.¡±
The company is tailoring games to appeal to the local market, such as the recent ¡°Moon Festival¡± version timed for the Mid-Autumn celebration last month, Vesterbacka said.
¡°Angry Birds¡± is the most-copied brand in China, the executive said. The company is taking inspiration from pirate merchandise, including mylar balloons featuring unlicensed characters from the game, for ideas on products to introduce, Vesterbacka said.
Merchandise makes up 10 percent to 20 percent of the business, and stuffed toys are selling a million units a month, Vesterbacka said in a Bloomberg Television interview this month. The ¡°insanely profitable¡± company may sell shares to the public as early as next year and is probably worth more than $1 billion, he said at the time.

105,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ Fuels Finland Game Boom as More Hits Emerge,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The success of ¡°Angry Birds¡± is helping Finland¡¯s other mobile-game fledglings take wing.
Enticed by the title¡¯s rapid rise to fame, venture-capital investors are flocking to the Nordic country in search of the next hit. The game developers attracting attention include the makers of ¡°Clash of Clans,¡± ¡°Hay Day¡± and ¡°Hill Climb Racing.¡± Each of those has had millions of downloads, joining ¡°Angry Birds¡± in Apple Inc.¡¯s application store¡¯s top lists.
Expanding at an annual pace of 57 percent, gaming has emerged as a niche growth industry for the country of 5 million seeking to diversify its economy as once-dominant mobile-phone maker Nokia Oyj shrinks and cuts thousands of jobs. ¡°Angry Birds¡± maker Rovio Entertainment Oy attracting $42 million in venture money in 2011 has helped local rivals including Supercell Oy and Grey Area Oy also lure international backers.
¡°There¡¯s an amazing critical mass here,¡± said Sean Seton-Rogers, general partner at London-based Profounders Capital, who joined thousands of investors and entrepreneurs in the Nordic region¡¯s biggest startup event, Slush, in Helsinki this week. ¡°Once you start having a viable ecosystem, it feeds off itself.¡±
Helsinki-based Supercell¡¯s ¡°Clash of Clans¡± was the top-grossing iPhone app in the U.S. as of yesterday, meaning its players spent the most money, including in-game purchases, according to appannie.com. Oulu, Finland-based Fingersoft Oy¡¯s ¡°Hill Climb Racing¡± was the most downloaded free game. Rovio¡¯s ¡°Angry Birds¡± was named the most downloaded paid app ever this year by Apple, and its ¡°Angry Birds Star Wars¡± edition is the most popular paid app now, according to appannie.com.
Mobile Boost
While Finnish startups are benefiting now from the extra engineering talent available as Nokia cuts jobs, the country¡¯s gaming industry is decades-old and began developing in the era of personal-computer titles. A shift in player preferences toward mobile phones and tablets, resulting in Rovio¡¯s success, gave the industry a shot in the arm, Seton-Rogers said.
¡°The market has really grown with the growth in mobile gaming,¡± said Seton-Rogers, who helps manage 30 million euros ($39 million) of venture funds and first invested in a Finnish startup, mobile gaming cross-promotion network Applifier, last year. ¡°As that¡¯s taken off, people pay more attention now.¡±
Supercell got a $12 million investment last year from Accel Partners, which also has a stake in Rovio and was an early backer of Facebook Inc. Grey Area, maker of the location-based multiplayer game ¡°Shadow Cities,¡± has raised money from investors including Index Ventures and London Venture Partners.
¡®Insanely Powerful¡¯
While Finnish game makers compete in some areas, they cooperate in others, sharing experiences as they seek global growth. Helping with that goal is Startup Sauna, a non-profit organization focused on polishing small businesses into world-beaters, based on pro bono input from coaches like Rovio Chief Marketing Officer Peter Vesterbacka and Supercell Chief Executive Officer Ilkka Paananen.
¡°It¡¯s all about the community, which makes it insanely powerful,¡± said Vesterbacka, a co-founder of Slush, welcoming visitors in his trademark red hooded sweatshirt to the event whose attendance doubled from last year to 3,000. ¡°It¡¯s cold and dark, but once you get inside, there are amazing startups.¡±
Developers also tend to move around, spreading talent. Supercell CEO Paananen, for instance, has held top positions in companies including Digital Chocolate Inc. and Sumea Oy, which developed games in the early 2000s in cooperation with Nokia.
Gaming Cluster
Finnish game-industry veterans including Matias Myllyrinne are embracing the new competition. Myllyrinne is the CEO of Remedy Entertainment Oy, the developer behind ¡°Max Payne¡± and ¡°Alan Wake,¡± which beat ¡°Angry Birds¡± for Time magazine¡¯s game of the year in 2010.
¡°It¡¯s absolutely fantastic -- the birth of a gaming cluster is good for everybody in the field,¡± he said in an interview. ¡°The threshold for me to call up the guys at Supercell or Rovio is not very high, and vice versa.¡±
In a change of pace from blockbuster titles developed for Microsoft Corp.¡¯s Xbox 360, Remedy has also tried its luck in mobile gaming, selling more than 10 million digital copies of ¡°Death Rally¡±.
¡°We¡¯ve started looking at tablets and mobile phones, there are fine opportunities for us to bring our knowhow,¡± he said. ¡°One can go see ¡®Lord of the Rings¡¯ on a big screen or watch YouTube clips, they serve a different function.¡±
Plush Toys
As mobile games typically cost a maximum of a few dollars, and many are free, the revenue the startups generate from game sales is limited. Many target extra revenue from selling ads and in-game features, as well as merchandise such as the ubiquitous ¡°Angry Birds¡± T-shirts, plush toys and candy.
The game industry in Finland grew 57 percent in 2011 to 165 million euros, according to the Finnish chapter of the International Game Developers Association. Growth has continued this year, with Supercell alone now grossing ¡°clearly above¡± $500,000 a day, helped by ¡°Clash of Clans¡± and ¡°Hay Day,¡± Paananen said in an interview. Apple takes a 30 percent cut of what a game on its system grosses, with the developer keeping the rest.
To help fuel the growth, Finland¡¯s government is planning tax breaks for minority investments in unlisted growth companies. Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen attended Slush, wearing colorful nail polish as he made his opening remarks, part of a publicity stunt for guitar-learning game ¡°GuitarBots.¡±
The nascent political support, coupled with the thriving game-industry community and the ¡°Angry Birds¡± success, make it easier for startups to stay in Finland and less necessary to relocate to Silicon Valley to gain funding.
¡°Helsinki is the best city in the world to build games at the moment,¡± Paananen said. ¡°People understand that it¡¯s possible to become global from Finland -- to have an example like Rovio is very inspiring and motivating.¡±

Dec. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Rovio Entertainment Oy, the Finnish maker of the Angry Birds mobile-phone game, may see revenue increase tenfold to $100 million this year, the Financial Times reported, without saying where it got the information.
Rovio, with downloads reaching 600 million since the game was released two years ago, may list on the stock market in New York or Hong Kong in the next few years as it seeks to become a household brand like Walt Disney Co., the newspaper said today.
Rovio received $42 million in funding in March from investors led by Facebook backer Accel Partners and Atomico Ventures. Some analysts have warned the company could be a ¡°one-hit wonder,¡± while Rovio has said it¡¯s developing new games, the FT said.

108,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ Maker May Seek Funds at $1.2 Billion Valuation,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Rovio Entertainment Oy, the Finnish creator of the ¡°Angry Birds¡± mobile-phone game, is in talks to receive funding that would value the company at about $1.2 billion, two people with knowledge of the discussions said.
The Espoo, Finland-based game maker is considering taking a strategic investment from a company in the entertainment business, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. The name of the entertainment company couldn¡¯t immediately be determined. Rovio has rejected similar offers from large institutional investors, the people said.
Rovio may use any new funds to fuel its expansion. The company plans to make an ¡°Angry Birds¡± movie and open offices outside of Finland, and is seeking to capitalize on the popularity of its brand in countries such as China, where it aims to sell stuffed animals and clothing in 200 retail stores.
The most likely investors in Rovio include game developers Electronic Arts Inc. and Zynga Inc., and media giants News Corp. and Walt Disney Co., said Michael Pachter, managing director of research at Wedbush Securities Inc. These companies could help Rovio reach new audiences, he said.
¡°I can see how Disney would take ¡®Angry Birds¡¯ and turn them into a theme-park ride and a movie,¡± said Pachter, who is based in Los Angeles. ¡°Zynga could take ¡®Angry Birds¡¯ and make it into ¡®FarmVille.¡¯¡±
Earlier Funding
In March, Rovio received $42 million in funding from investors including Skype Technologies SA co-founder Niklas Zennstrom¡¯s Atomico as well as Facebook Inc. backer Accel Partners.
Sini Matikainen, a spokeswoman for Rovio, declined to comment on the company¡¯s funding plans. Jeff Brown, a spokesman for Electronic Arts, declined to comment on potential investments. Dani Dudeck, a spokeswoman for Zynga, also declined to comment, as did Dan Berger, a spokesman for News Corp. in Los Angeles. Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Disney, didn¡¯t immediately respond to a request for comment.
¡°Angry Birds¡± is one of several Web games to be offered on Google Inc.¡¯s new social-networking site, the Mountain View, California-based company said in a blog post yesterday.

109,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ Maker Urges Court to Let Apple Join Patent Lawsuit,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. should be allowed to intervene in a patent-infringement lawsuit against developers of iPhone applications, according to a court filing by Electronic Arts Inc. and ¡®Angry Birds¡¯ maker Rovio Entertainment Oy.
Closely held Lodsys LLC filed suit in May, contending that two of its patents for ways to interact with customers are infringed by iPhone applications including ¡°Angry Birds,¡± Combay Inc.¡¯s ¡°Mega Poker Online Texas Holdem,¡± and ¡°The Sims 3¡± by Electronic Arts. Apple has argued in court papers that its license with Lodsys covers the app developers as well and wants to join the case on their behalf.
¡°The participation of Apple as a party in this lawsuit is critical to the development of the very evidence needed to establish what may prove to be a complete defense to the infringement claims in this action,¡± the app developers said in a federal court filing yesterday in support of Cupertino, California-based Apple¡¯s request.
Lodsys, based in Marshall, Texas, where the lawsuit was filed, objected to Apple¡¯s request. It said companies such as Electronic Arts and Rovio are big enough to handle their own defense, and there is no evidence that the lawsuit disrupts Apple¡¯s relationship with developers.
Electronic Arts, based in Redwood City, California, is the second-largest U.S. video-game publisher. Espoo, Finland-based Rovio has had more than 250 million downloads of its ¡°Angry Birds¡± game on mobile phones and other electronic devices.
Other Developers
Other app developers named in the Lodsys complaint are Atari SA¡¯s Atari Interactive Inc., maker of Atari¡¯s Greatest Hits for the iPhone and iPad; Iconfactory Inc., maker of Twitterrific; Illusion Labs AB, maker of Labyrinth; Michael G. Karr, maker of Shovelmate¡¯s 69 Positions; Quickoffice Inc., maker of Quickoffice Connect; Square Enix Ltd., maker of Big Hit Baseball; and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., maker of 2K Sports NHL.
All of the developers named in the complaint also signed the statement in support of Apple being allowed to join the case. Apple has said it needs to be able to protect agreements it has covering more than 425,000 apps.
¡°This litigation has fundamentally disrupted Apple¡¯s relationships with the developers and with other developers, and places in jeopardy the revenue that Apple derives from those relationships,¡± the company said in a June filing.
No date has been sent for U.S. District Judge T. John Ward to decide on Apple¡¯s request.
The case is Lodsys LLC v. Combay Inc., 11cv272, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Marshall).

110,"¡®Angry Birds¡¯ Maker May Hold IPO in 2012, Mighty Eagle Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Rovio Entertainment Oy, the Finnish creator of ¡°Angry Birds¡± mobile-phone games, may sell shares to the public as early as next year and is probably worth more than $1 billion, its chief marketing officer said.
¡°We¡¯re not ready to file for an IPO tomorrow,¡± Peter Vesterbacka, who also goes by the title Mighty Eagle, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ¡°Maybe a year from now.¡±
The touchscreen game, in which players use a virtual slingshot to fling birds at structures populated by green pigs, has had 400 million free and paid downloads since 2009, with three fourths of those in the last six months. Rovio is hiring in the U.S. and China to develop activities such as retail and movies, and is worth more than $1 billion, based on funding talks, people with knowledge of the discussions said in August.
¡°We¡¯re happy with our valuation but we think it¡¯s probably a bit north of that,¡± said Vesterbacka. Espoo-based Rovio, which announced in June it took over Finnish animation studio Kombo, is weighing more acquisitions, he said.
Vesterbacka, 43, previously spent 14 years at Hewlett-Packard Co. selling systems to phone companies and encouraging mobile developers. He discovered the team that would become Rovio in an HP-sponsored games contest in 2003.
¡®Insanely Profitable¡¯
The Angry Birds brand also makes cash via advertising, in-game purchases and physical merchandise including T-shirts, Halloween costumes, stuffed toys and a cookbook. Rovio has benefitted from publicity, including a mention by Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, who praised Vesterbacka and Angry Birds this year ¡°for creating an occupation for a huge number of officials who now know what to do with their leisure time.¡±
Merchandise is 10 to 20 percent of the business, and stuffed toys, priced $8.99 to $69.99 on the company¡¯s website, are selling a million units a month, Vesterbacka said.
¡°We¡¯re insanely profitable,¡± he said. ¡°We are very, very profitable. We¡¯re not a publicly traded company yet but we can fund our own growth.¡±
Vesterbacka worked on other startups after leaving HP in 2006, and joined Rovio in early 2010. The company has gone from a dozen people to about 200 since then. Now the Finn, often clad in a red hoodie, represents the company at events around the world, while Chief Executive Officer Mikael Hed runs the show in Espoo.
¡®Billion Fans¡¯
Hires this year include David Maisel, former chairman of Marvel Studios, which produced the ¡°Iron Man¡± films, to be special adviser and executive producer of Angry Birds movies. The company also recruited former Tele2 CEO Harri Koponen, who hired Vesterbacka at HP, to head merchandise including books.
Rovio experienced its first high-profile departure with the exit of Wibe Wagemans, senior vice president of brand advertising, who was working on alliances with Starbucks and other retail brands.
Tie-ups with other companies include a deal with Finnair Oyj, which offered fans seats to play ¡°Angry Birds¡± in the air in a promotional flight to Singapore last month, and bookseller Barnes & Noble Inc., which offers free access to the 99-cent ¡°Mighty Eagle¡± feature to users of its Nook tablet device while they¡¯re in its stores.
¡°We think we have a good shot at being the first entertainment brand that has a billion fans -- people we can talk to and have a dialog with every day,¡± said Vesterbacka. The company now has about 150 million ¡°active users,¡± he said.
Games Charts
The company published 51 games for Nokia Oyj phones and other handsets before releasing ¡°Angry Birds,¡± which has had multiple runs at the top of the charts at online application stores in many countries, including Apple Inc.¡¯s online app store in the U.S.
¡°Before the iPhone and the app stores, if you weren¡¯t friends with the handset makers, even if you made a great game you couldn¡¯t get it out there,¡± Vesterbacka said. ¡°There were all these people on gateways controlling what went out. The app store model has changed the dynamics.¡±
¡°Angry Birds¡± zoomed to the top of the iPhone charts last year before being rolled out for Android phones, desktop computers, and Barnes & Noble¡¯s Nook e-reader. It¡¯s on Nokia¡¯s current smartphones and on Windows Phone 7, and Rovio has been working on a social-media version for Facebook.
Footsteps of Disney
In March, Rovio received $42 million in funding from investors including Skype Technologies SA co-founder Niklas Zennstrom¡¯s Atomico as well as Facebook backer Accel Partners. It¡¯s ¡°very possible¡± that Rovio will seek another venture-capital round before eventually holding an initial public offering, possibly in two to three years, CEO Hed said in June.
¡°We¡¯re still building a lot of our infrastructure, our company, our platform, everything,¡± Vesterbacka said. ¡°There¡¯s a lot of good discipline in having to be ready to go public.¡±
The company is working on a 20-year plan for Angry Birds, Vesterbacka said. The rapidly changing nature of media distribution means Angry Birds movies could even go ¡°direct to app,¡± he said.
¡°Disney started as a black and white cartoon about this little mouse,¡± he said. ¡°Nintendo has been working on Mario for 26 years. Angry Birds is less than two years old.¡±

111,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ May Take On ¡®StarCraft¡¯ in Korea After Rule Change,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
July 7 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. customers in South Korea who couldn¡¯t download Rovio Mobile Ltd.¡¯s best-selling ¡°Angry Birds¡± on their iPhones will soon be able to find out why flinging vindictive fowl at green hogs can be addictive.
Korea scrapped rules yesterday requiring developers to have mobile games rated by the government, said Yi Ki Jeong, a manager at the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in Seoul. The rule clashed with internal policies at Apple and Google Inc. enough for the companies to shut their mobile-game stores in the country, keeping Rovio and other developers from offering their products in Korea, Yi said.
The lifting of the law clears the way for software developers for the iPhone and handsets that run on Google¡¯s Android system to offer games in a nation where cable TV channels broadcast live matches of people playing Activision Blizzard Inc.¡¯s ¡°StarCraft.¡± Sales of mobile games will probably exceed 355 billion won ($333 million) next year, according to the government.
¡°A new chapter is opening in the Korean smartphone-game market,¡± said Jang Woo Jin, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co. ¡°With the rule out of the way, we can now expect Apple and Google to throw open games in Korea.¡±
Deprived IPhone Users
Korean mobile-game developers such as Gamevil Inc. and Com2uS Corp. may also benefit by offering games on Google¡¯s Android Market and Apple¡¯s App Store, said Jang. Gamevil¡¯s third-quarter sales in Korea may rise as much as 17 percent if the companies reopen their game sections on their local stores, he said. The shares have risen 27 percent this year.
The removal of the regulatory hurdle is a ¡°hugely favorable factor¡± for Gamevil, Kim Young Sik, a spokesman for the company, said. ¡°Millions of iPhone users in Korea haven¡¯t been able to use games until now.¡±
Gamevil¡¯s ¡°Air Penguin¡± was the fourth-most downloaded paid application for the iPhone in the U.S. in April, according to Utrecht, Netherlands-based researcher Distimo.
Com2uS, a Seoul-based maker of iPhone games such as ¡°Third Blade¡± and ¡°Homerun Battle 3D,¡± is aiming to triple smartphone-game sales to 25.9 billion won this year, said Choi Baek Yong, the company¡¯s chief financial officer.
¡°We¡¯re looking at this very positively,¡± Choi said.
Robin Moroney, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Google, and Steve Park, a Seoul-based spokesman for Apple, declined to comment on the rule change and introduction of new games. Ville Heijari, vice president of franchise development at Rovio, didn¡¯t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
Gaming Country
South Korea, home to mobile-phone makers Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc., had 14 million smartphone users as of the end of June, according to estimates from Park Jong Soo, an analyst at Hanwha Securities Co. in Seoul. Apple controlled about 29 percent of the market for smartphones at the end of last month, according to Park.
Even with the game categories closed, application downloads in May in South Korea exceeded those of countries with bigger populations such as Germany and France, according to researcher Distimo.
Korea isn¡¯t scrapping regulations altogether.
For example, the National Assembly in April passed a bill to prohibit adolescents under 16 years old from playing online games past midnight to curb addiction.
¡°Previously, the government censored movies for social and ethical reasons to protect Korean values,¡± Yi said. ¡°That tradition is still alive in games.¡±
Internet Cafes
Games for the iPhone stand to benefit more from the change of rules than Android applications, as some titles running on the Google software are already available on application stores run by local mobile-phone carriers, Com2uS¡¯s Choi said.
Angry Birds can be downloaded by Android users in the country using carriers such as SK Telecom Co.
The popularity of online games in South Korea, the world¡¯s second-biggest market for games that allow players from remote places to play together, may bode well for mobile games.
Korea Creative Content Agency forecasts online game sales in the country, which has Internet cafes sprawling across the nation and professional leagues for online-game players, will almost double to 7.1 trillion won by 2012 from 2009.
¡°Mobile games as an industry have a lot of growth potential,¡± the culture ministry¡¯s Yi said. ¡°We are now letting Google and Apple open their markets here. We hope Koreans will be able to use their global markets, not having to take an alternative route and download from overseas markets.¡±

112,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ Poised to Fly Onto Web-Enabled TVs Via Roku Accord,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 1 (Bloomberg) -- Roku Inc., the television set-top box maker spun off by Netflix Inc., is adding the ¡°Angry Birds¡± game to its service, marking the first time the popular title played on iPhones and iPads has been available on TVs.
Three versions of ¡®Angry Birds¡¯ will be available for purchase later this year, Chief Executive Officer Anthony Wood said in an interview. Players in the game fire birds from slingshots at fortresses of pigs who have stolen their eggs.
Casual games would help closely held Roku boost revenue as more companies vie to offer products on Web-enabled TVs. Sony Corp., Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp. stream games, movies and TV shows on their game consoles. ¡°Angry Birds¡± has been a top-selling application on Apple Inc.¡¯s iPhone and later iPad since its debut in December 2009.
¡°We think casual games are going to be big on TV,¡± Wood said. Customers wanting to play the game will need to buy a new Roku Player coming out this year, he said, declining to reveal details of its cost or new features.
Roku¡¯s set-top boxes provide Internet links that allow TV viewers to watch movies rentals from Netflix or pipe music from services such as Pandora through their home entertainment systems. Samsung Electronics Co., LG Electronics Inc. and other television makers are introducing sets that let users stream content directly from the Web without a set-top box.
Google Inc. and Apple Inc. also are vying to deliver popular TV shows and movies through consumer electronic gear.
Revenue Sharing
Roku, based in Saratoga, California, will get 30 percent of the revenue from sales of the game, ¡°Angry Birds¡± short videos and merchandise sold through its Internet TV platform, Wood said. Roku is negotiating with other casual-games makers to deliver additional titles, he said.
Helsinki-based Rovio Mobile Oy, maker of ¡°Angry Birds,¡± and other publishers of iPhone games are trying to develop cross-media franchises based on their hit digital characters.
¡°Roku¡¯s strong platform enables us to introduce the full ¡¯Angry Birds¡¯ experience of games, videos and merchandise to the TV,¡± Peter Vesterbacka, Rovio¡¯s chief marketing officer, said in a statement.
Roku, which has sold more than 1 million of its devices, plans to continue cutting the price of its boxes, which sold for $115 in May 2008 and now go for as little as $60.
Netflix hired Wood in 2007 to help the DVD-rental company move develop an online service. Netflix planned to release its own box until Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings decided to stay out of the hardware business. Wood created a separate company, and Netflix backed it with $6 million.

113,Rovio Executive Says ¡®Angry Birds Space¡¯ Skips Windows Phone,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 23 (Bloomberg) -- An executive of the maker of ¡°Angry Birds¡± said the latest edition of the world¡¯s most popular mobile-phone game won¡¯t appear on Microsoft Corp.¡¯s Windows Phone platform, a possible blow to handset maker Nokia Oyj.
¡°We¡¯re the No. 1 app in the Windows Phone app store, but it¡¯s a big undertaking to support it, and you have to completely rewrite the application,¡± Peter Vesterbacka, chief marketing officer of the game¡¯s maker, Rovio Entertainment Oy, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. He said Rovio, which yesterday started selling the new ¡°Angry Birds Space¡± game for Apple Inc.¡¯s iPhone and handsets running Google Inc.¡¯s Android platform, has no plans to release the title on Windows Phone.
Rovio Chief Executive Officer Mikael Hed later told Reuters the company was ¡°working towards¡± getting ¡°Angry Birds Space¡± on the Windows Phone 7 operating system. Hed didn¡¯t return calls by Bloomberg News. Ville Heijari, a spokesman for Rovio, said in e-mailed statement that the company is working toward offering its games on ¡°all relevant platforms¡± and that it will announce ¡°further platforms as soon as more information is available.¡±
Nokia is betting on the Windows Phone operating system to revive its struggling smartphone business. The lack of ¡°Angry Birds¡± may make it more difficult for the company, based in the same Espoo, Finland-based office park as Rovio, to attract gaming-oriented users and persuade developers that its platform is growing.
China Push
¡°This is a worrying development for Windows Phone because it suggests that Rovio does not have much confidence in its future,¡± Nomura analyst Richard Windsor said today in a report. ¡°As the standard version is already number one on the Windows Phone app store, it gives a strong indication that no one else will expect to be making money writing for this platform either.¡±
Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop has introduced several Windows Phones since October and plans to bring the handsets next to China, where ¡°Angry Birds¡± took off last year.
¡°China has been our second-largest market, but it¡¯s actually been the fastest-growing for quite a while, and it could well be that China becomes the biggest market this year,¡± Vesterbacka said.
Nokia spokesman James Etheridge had no immediate comment when contacted today. The company¡¯s shares rose 0.9 percent to 3.98 euros at the close in Helsinki. The stock has declined 33 percent in the past 12 months.
Elop, who took over at the world¡¯s largest mobile-phone maker in 2010, shifted to Windows Phone last year after determining Nokia¡¯s Symbian and MeeGo systems couldn¡¯t keep up with Android, the fastest-growing smartphone platform, and the iPhone.
Chicken and Egg
Microsoft plans to bring its Windows Phone software to 23 more countries for a total of 63 and put the operating system on less expensive smartphones, it said last month. The company aims to move quickly in developing economies, where Google and Apple are less dominant, before cheaper Android phones can strengthen Google¡¯s position.
¡°There is a chicken and egg situation here, where no apps means no users and no users means no apps,¡± Windsor said. ¡°Nokia has tried in the past to get past this by paying developers directly to write applications but it has largely failed to bring any life back to the platform.¡±
For the time being, it¡¯s too expensive for Rovio to adapt new games to Windows Phones, Vesterbacka said.
¡°If you look at activations, Apple¡¯s iOS and Android are clearly bigger than any other platform,¡± he said. ¡°We want to be on all screens, but we have to consider the cost of supplying the smaller platforms. With Windows Phone it¡¯s a lot of work to technically support it.¡±
Flinging Birds
¡°Angry Birds¡± may reach a billion cumulative downloads in the next few months, boosted by the introduction of ¡°Space,¡± and 2 billion by the end of the year, he said. That compares to just 50 million in late 2010, a year after the unveiling of the original game. Rovio predicts to introduce four more Angry Birds games by the end of the year, Vesterbacka said.
Basic ¡°Angry Birds¡± game play consists of using a virtual slingshot to fling birds at structures populated by green pigs. The game zoomed to the top of the chart in Apple¡¯s online app store in 2010 before being rolled out for Android phones, desktop computers and e-readers. The Facebook version is approaching 20 million active users, Vesterbacka said.
Rovio, which has more than 300 employees, also sold about 25 million plush toys last year and has started a book division with a cookbook and comics.
Closely held Rovio published 51 games for Nokia phones and other handsets before releasing ¡°Angry Birds.¡± The game is on Nokia¡¯s current smartphones and some lower-end models.
The new version of ¡°Angry Birds,¡± which takes place in space with planetary gravity interfering with the birds¡¯ flight paths, is available for Windows personal computers as well as Apple Mac computers.

114,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ Fly High in Finland Quest for Nokia 2.0,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Nov. 29 (Bloomberg) -- At the Virtual Goods Summit at London¡¯s Chelsea Football Club this month, Peter Vesterbacka told the gathered cyber geeks to prepare for a surprise follow-up to ¡°Angry Birds,¡± the Finnish megahit mobile-phone game.
With its arsenal of birds fired from slingshots at fortresses of pigs who¡¯ve stolen their eggs, the game raced up the charts on Apple Inc.¡¯s iPhone to become the bestselling app in 61 countries. The more than 10 million paid iPhone downloads at about $1 a pop have raked in profits for Espoo, Finland-based Rovio Mobile Oy, where Vesterbacka, dubbed the ¡°Mighty Eagle,¡± is chief marketing officer.
¡°No one has told the story from the pigs¡¯ point of view,¡± Vesterbacka told the summit attendees.
Rovio is a star Finnish start-up in a country struggling to fill the gap left by the declining value of its best-known company, Nokia Oyj. Finland¡¯s Act II to put the northernmost euro-area nation back on the global technology map may result in several small wins like Angry Birds and Web payment-tools developer APE Payment Oy rather than a Nokia-sized triumph.
¡°We won¡¯t get another Nokia,¡± said Risto Siilasmaa, a Nokia board member who founded software company F-Secure Oyj as an engineering student in 1988. ¡°But we should definitely get 10 or 100 F-Secures and a lot of Angry Birds and APE Payments.¡±
Nokia¡¯s Decline
At its peak in 2000, Nokia accounted for 4 percent of Finland¡¯s gross domestic product. With advances by iPhones and devices using Google Inc.¡¯s Android software, analysts estimate Nokia¡¯s profit will shrink to 1.6 billion euros ($2.1 billion) this year from 7.2 billion in 2007. Nokia¡¯s share of Finland¡¯s economy diminished to 1.6 percent of GDP last year, according to Helsinki-based economic research institute ETLA.
The Finnish government, faced with Europe¡¯s fastest-aging population, needs to create jobs to pay for the growing costs of pensions and healthcare. By 2015, three working Finns will be supporting every pensioner, down from about four now. In Europe as a whole, the change will take 10 years longer, according to Eurostat, the European Union¡¯s statistics agency. Finland¡¯s economy shrank 8 percent last year.
To compensate for Nokia¡¯s fading fortunes, the government is boosting support for young innovators. The national research funding agency, Tekes, doubled financing to promising ventures to 30 million euros a year through 2014. Other programs put total state funding at more than 60 million euros.
Start-Up Bootcamp
The first government-sponsored ¡°Summer of Start-ups¡± bootcamp was in full swing this year at Aalto University, the nation¡¯s flagship technology campus just down the road from Nokia, drawing the likes of Timo Herttua, a 23-year-old with a sales-force software company called Deal Machine.
¡°This grassroots student stuff is what¡¯s going to create the 10 to 20 companies we need to replace the huge growth that¡¯s not going to happen from Nokia and other Finnish companies that will primarily grow elsewhere,¡± says Will Cardwell, who directs the entrepreneurship center at the university. ¡°Finland needs to create multiple 100 million-euro-plus growth companies to make the demographic math of the future work.¡±
U.S. companies like Apple, Intel Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. were founded by people with an average age of about 26, he said. Herttua and Tuomo Riekki, 22, who met in the army, had both set up their own Web design businesses as teenagers. After a few months of sales, they have a 30,000-euro grant from Tekes and more than 560 customers for Deal Machine, which uses game mechanics to push sales reps toward their goals.
California Calling
The Finnish environment isn¡¯t always conducive to nurturing and keeping start-ups, said Siilasmaa. High taxes, a lack of incentives for investors and remote major markets have hampered them, prompting entrepreneurs to leave or sell out.
The founders of software start-ups Jaiku, a Twitter twin, and MySQL, a database system, sold to Google and Sun Microsystems Inc. in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Finland¡¯s Linus Torvalds, who wrote the Linux open software as a student, moved to California in 1997.
Kristo Ovaska, the co-founder of the Aalto Entrepreneurship Society, last month took a group including Riekki and Herttua to California, where they practiced pitching their projects to tech bloggers and investors.
¡°Young entrepreneurs need to go learn from the best in the world,¡± Ovaska, 27, said. ¡°Even if they leave, eventually some of them would come back and help other young start-ups.¡±
The Deal Machine founders plan to move to Silicon Valley next year to be closer to emerging technological developments.
¡®Lack Incentives¡¯
¡°Traditionally in Finland entrepreneurs were considered misfits who couldn¡¯t get a job with the government or a big company,¡± Siilasmaa said. ¡°That¡¯s changing, but we still lack incentives that would encourage successful business people to invest time and money in start-ups.¡±
Raising money for the start-ups won¡¯t be easy. Finland¡¯s venture funding is meager. Finnish high-tech companies raised about 50 million euros, or $70 million, in venture funding in the first half, according to Technopolis Oyj, a firm that ¡°incubates¡± tech companies and helps them raise funds. That compares with $577 million in Israel.
Fruugo Oy, which started a multinational European shopping site in 2009, raised less than half the capital it aimed for in Finland. It merged with Britain¡¯s Directory Technology Ltd., in September, taking over its partner¡¯s ShoppingBank.com website.
Software is a popular choice for Finnish start-ups. Among companies that may eventually help plug the Nokia deficit are Sulake Corp. Oy, a profitable game company that runs the virtual ¡°Habbo Hotel¡±; Grey Area Oy Ab, whose ¡°Shadow Cities¡± game has soared on apps lists, and APE Payment, whose software allows users to make payments of a fraction of a cent, to buy a letter in a crossword puzzle, for example.
Venture Capitalists
Nokia ¡°has been a very important source of new innovative companies in Finland¡± through spinoffs and as its engineers started their own companies, said Esko Aho, a former Finnish prime minister and now a Nokia executive vice president for corporate relations and responsibility.
Although Finland hasn¡¯t yet produced an iconic consumer software product like Swedish-Danish-Estonian developed Skype SARL or Sweden¡¯s Spotify Ltd., Angry Birds comes close.
The Rovio team produced 51 other games, many for Nokia handsets, before Angry Birds took flight with more than 36 million free and paid downloads.
¡°There are only a handful of venture capitalists in Finland and to get the attention of foreign venture capitalists has been quite challenging from here,¡± says Chief Executive Officer Mikael Hed.
Christmas Birds
Rovio, whose founders met at a local hacking contest in 2003, funded itself with family help, including from Hed¡¯s father. Hed¡¯s brand empire for Angry Birds, which already has stuffed toys and Youtube videos, is taking the company farther away from its roots as a maker of games orbiting Nokia.
Rovio plans to announce versions for the holiday season, for multiplayer game consoles and for Facebook. The company, which celebrates the first year of Angry Birds on Dec. 10, today said it will soon demonstrate ¡°a brand new Angry Birds experience.¡±
¡°Angry Birds is the perfect example of the challenge that has faced Finland in the last five years,¡± says Ben Holmes, a London-based partner at Geneva venture capitalists Index Ventures. ¡°It was porting game software to phones manufactured by traditional manufacturers like Nokia and Motorola and then along comes iPhone and they have that breakaway success.¡±

115,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ Staying Power Tested With CEO Hatching Movie,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 27 (Bloomberg) -- On a recent visit with his two children to a toy museum in Espoo, Finland, Mikael Hed was struck by a display of action figures from George Lucas¡¯s ¡°Star Wars¡± series.
¡°The only toys I felt were still very cool and still worth playing with were the ¡®Star Wars¡¯ toys,¡± said the 35-year-old chief executive officer of the Finnish mobile-phone game developer that¡¯s still riding its first big hit, ¡°Angry Birds,¡± after designing games the past eight years.
Rovio Mobile Oy faces a long haul to convince investors that the touchscreen game where players stretch and release a virtual catapult to hurl birds at structures populated by green pigs will command the same staying power. After racking up 250 million downloads, Rovio now wants to make an ¡°Angry Birds¡± movie, develop more game titles for casual gamers, and open offices outside Finland to bring in more gaming and storytelling talent.
The company published 51 games for Nokia Oyj phones and other handsets before striking gold with ¡°Angry Birds,¡± which zoomed to the top of the iPhone charts last year before being rolled out for Android phones, desktop computers, and Barnes & Noble Inc.¡¯s Nook e-reader. It¡¯s already on Nokia¡¯s just-announced N9 smartphone. A Facebook version is in the works.
Birds on Walls
The 99-cent game is again the top paid app in Apple Inc.¡¯s U.S. app store after being toppled by new entrant Heist in March. Angry Birds Rio, a version with a tie-in to the animated movie ¡°Rio,¡± is the third-most popular. The first run of ¡°Angry Birds¡± in the top spot, a free version, lasted a record 275 days, according to website The Loop.
¡°We¡¯re working on a number of new concepts, but we¡¯re fully aware that ¡®Angry Birds¡¯ is probably going to be the dominant brand we have for quite a while,¡± Hed said in an interview at Rovio¡¯s new office down the street from Nokia in Espoo, featuring living-room-style areas for laptop working and bird cartoons stencilled on the walls.
In March, Rovio received $42 million in funding from investors including Skype Technologies SA co-founder Niklas Zennstrom¡¯s Atomico Ventures as well as Facebook backer Accel Partners. It¡¯s ¡°very possible¡± that Rovio will seek another venture-capital round before eventually holding an initial public offering, possibly in two to three years, Hed said.
IPO Risks
Firms that get early-stage venture capital typically give 20 percent to 40 percent to their investors, said Nordea Bank analyst Sami Sarkamies. Based on that, the March deal valued the game maker at as much as $210 million at the time.
¡°If they are able to replicate the success of ¡®Angry Birds¡¯ with other titles, it may be a candidate for an IPO but with one title it¡¯s difficult,¡± said Sarkamies. ¡°The risk of not being able to do it and getting into trouble later on may just be too high.¡±
Another risk is how long Internet valuations remain buoyed. Signs of a slowing U.S. economic recovery and the initial public offering of LinkedIn Corp. have sparked concern that the industry may have entered a speculative bubble.
Hed, a business graduate at Tulane University in New Orleans, helped start Rovio under the name Relude Oy when his cousin Niklas Hed began writing games with some classmates from what¡¯s now Aalto University. Rovio is chaired by Hed¡¯s father, Kaj, who first invested in the company in 2005.
Studio Talks
Mikael Hed quit as CEO in 2005, feeling the company wasn¡¯t big enough for both him and his father, and the two agreed on his re-entry in 2009. In the interim he co-wrote August Jessor, a comic series about a police chief in a remote town.
Writers are developing a script for a full-length ¡°Angry Birds¡± film that would fill in the backstory of the birds and pigs. Rovio has spoken to major movie studios and is working with partners of the caliber of Walt Disney Co.¡¯s Pixar to produce and distribute the movie, Hed said.
¡°We are working on the mythology with the movie script and we don¡¯t want to shape the mythology too far until we have that one nail in place,¡± the CEO said. ¡°We¡¯ve seen too many movies based on games that have not performed well.¡±
Rovio created a special edition of ¡°Angry Birds¡± with characters from the animated film ¡°Rio¡± produced by News Corp.¡¯s Twentieth Century Fox. A bird resembling Rovio¡¯s avians appeared in the film trailer, which was aired during the Super Bowl.
Maisel¡¯s Role
The company said today it appointed David Maisel, former chairman of Marvel Studios, which produced the ¡°Iron Man¡± films, to be special adviser and executive producer of ¡°Angry Birds¡± movies. A veteran of Hollywood agencies, Maisel led the sale of Marvel Entertainment to Disney in 2010.
Meanwhile, Hed said demand for the touchscreen game hasn¡¯t peaked. Peter Vesterbacka, the red-sweatshirt-clad Rovio executive who holds the title of ¡°Mighty Eagle¡± and handles relations with U.S. partners, told a conference in London this month that in China alone, Rovio is aiming for 100 million downloads with customized versions of the game.
¡°People are still migrating from old-fashioned phones to touchscreen devices, and in emerging markets, that¡¯s creating whole new audiences that may not have a TV before but now could have an Android device,¡± Hed said. ¡°Catering to that audience is important for any media company in the future.¡±

116,¡®Angry Birds¡¯ Tapped in Nokia Push Toward Wireless Payments,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 3 (Bloomberg) -- Nokia Oyj has recruited the makers of the ¡°Angry Birds¡± mobile-phone game to give a boost to short-range technology that may become the wireless standard for consumers paying for merchandise with a swipe of the handset.
The mobile-phone maker is working on completing an upgrade of its Symbian software in coming months that will switch on the near-field communications capability on its C7 smartphone, said Sixten Sandstroem, a Nokia manager responsible for business partnerships in so-called NFC. The model, which went on sale with T-Mobile USA last month as the Astound, is Nokia¡¯s first widely sold handset that carries the NFC function.
Nokia, one of the pioneers of the technology, risks being caught up by rivals including Google Inc. With applications such as exchanging business cards between handsets and retrieving information at museum exhibits and bus stops driving usage, as many as 70 million NFC devices may be sold this year, according to Richard Clemmer, chief executive officer of NXP Semiconductor NV, a maker of chips that power the technology.
¡°The C7 is just the beginning,¡± Sandstroem said in Espoo, Finland. ¡°We want to create an open ecosystem which means we will partner with trusted service managers, credit cards, everyone.¡±
While Nokia will ship phones on Microsoft Corp.¡¯s Windows 7 operating system in large volumes in 2012, the company has a target to sell another 150 million phones based on the Symbian operating system. The number of NFC-enabled devices sold may rise to 300 million in 2013, NXP¡¯s Clemmer predicts.
¡®Angry Birds Magic¡¯
NFC complements the earlier short-range wireless system Bluetooth by making it easier to exchange small amounts of information with a tap. Bluetooth connections with headsets, speakers and other devices, for example, can be started and stopped by tapping two NFC-equipped devices against each other, a simpler method than current ways of connecting.
Rovio Mobile Oy, maker of ¡°Angry Birds,¡± is taking the megahit game to its next level with an NFC-enabled version. ¡°Angry Birds Magic¡± will give players 20 more screens in which they fire birds from a slingshot at structures built by their porcine enemies. Five playing scenes are available from the start. Users must then find other players with NFC-equipped phones and tap handsets with them to unlock further levels.
¡°We¡¯re going to use the power of our brand to maybe bring NFC to a wider user base so people realize what the technology is,¡± said Matthew Wilson, a marketing manager at Espoo-based Rovio. ¡°It¡¯s not going to be highly profitable at first but it¡¯s something we¡¯d like to be involved in.¡±
Paying by Phone
Nokia has experimented with NFC projects as early as 2004 and introduced its first handset adapted for the technology that year. With the wireless industry taking time to agree on the technical standards, customers are designing networks that also work with contactless cards such as credit cards, transit passes and loyalty cards.
Part of the technology¡¯s promise lies in folding the contents of users¡¯ wallets into the mobile phone, and in making it possible to integrate coupons and other immediate offers into the payment process.
The need for cooperation from merchants, banks, regulators and trusted service managers to verify users¡¯ identity has slowed NFC¡¯s adoption as a payment channel. Nokia sold its shares in Venyon Oy, which provided TSM services, to Germany¡¯s Giesecke & Devrient GmbH in 2009.
Symbian Shift
¡°It¡¯s a chicken-and-egg problem,¡± said Geoff Blaber, a London-based analyst at CCS Insight. ¡°NFC is not a cheap component to integrate into a phone, so as much as manufacturers may want to, until there¡¯s something that generates demand pull, it¡¯ll be a nice-to-have on the feature tick-list rather than a strategic necessity.¡±
NFC hardware may cost as much as $5 per handset, CCS Insight said in a February report, noting ¡°a lack of urgency to add this feature in the absence of sustained operator demand.¡±
Nokia withdrew a planned NFC handset last year, citing changes in its product lines.
Last week, Nokia agreed to transfer its Symbian software operations to Accenture Plc, weeks after announcing Symbian Anna, the version of Symbian that will enable NFC, and two Symbian smartphones. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, who met shareholders at the company¡¯s annual meeting in Helsinki today, is focusing on shifting Nokia¡¯s main Symbian smartphone platform to Microsoft Corp.¡¯s Windows Phone 7.
Accenture Pact
Last week, Nokia agreed to transfer its Symbian software operations to Accenture Plc, weeks after announcing Symbian Anna, the version of Symbian that will enable NFC, and two Symbian smartphones. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, who met shareholders at the company¡¯s annual meeting in Helsinki today, is focusing on shifting Nokia¡¯s main Symbian smartphone platform to Microsoft Corp.¡¯s Windows Phone 7.
Nokia has fallen 23 percent since the company announced the Microsoft shift on Feb. 11. Speaking to more than 3,300 shareholders at the company¡¯s annual meeting, Chairman Jorma Ollila said the board stands behind the new strategy.
Elop, 47, a former Microsoft executive, ¡°has moved Nokia forward in many ways,¡± Ollila told shareholders. He cited the CEO¡¯s ¡°huge amount of energy and desire to succeed,¡± as well as his software background and experience at other companies.
Paying the Bills
Research in Motion Ltd., the BlackBerry maker, yesterday unveiled the BlackBerry Bold 9900 and 9930 smartphones that include built-in support for NFC. Google Inc. supports NFC in its latest version of Android and shipped its first phone with the capability, the Nexus S, in December.
¡°We¡¯ve done our homework, we¡¯re ready, once the networks roll out we produce the phones,¡± said Gerhard Romen, director of financial services in Nokia¡¯s low-end mobile phones business, when asked about the company¡¯s readiness for NFC payment networks. ¡°It¡¯s not about us delivering phones that nobody uses and we carry the cost. It is about the market taking those.¡±
Nokia executives declined to comment on the company¡¯s plans for using NFC on Window Phone 7. Nokia won¡¯t include NFC in the X7 and E6 announced on April 12, spokesman Andrew Flowers said.
Nokia closed little changed at 6.29 euros Helsinki. It has fallen 31 percent in the past year, cutting the company¡¯s market value to 23.5 billion euros ($35 billion).
Samsung Electronics Co. expects to sell more than 10 million units of its Galaxy II S model Android phone, which includes NFC. Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications Ltd. has also said it will offer NFC on an upcoming handset.
¡°Mobile payments, at the end of the day, will pay the bill for NFC,¡± said Dan Hays, a Washington-based partner at management consultants PRTM. ¡°Releasing NFC-enabled phones before the ecosystem is ready will only mean that companies like Nokia will generate additional manufacturing costs and not be able to generate a sufficient return for them.¡±

May 15 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Angry Birds,¡± the video game that conquered small screens to become the top-selling mobile-phone application of all time, is coming to the big screen.
The animated 3-D film is being developed, produced and financed by the game¡¯s publisher, Espoo, Finland-based Rovio Entertainment Oy, and will be distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment on July 1, 2016, the companies said in an e-mailed statement today.
Sony Pictures was among several major Hollywood studios to seek distribution rights for a film version of the game, in which players use a virtual slingshot to hurl birds at targets, the companies said. Versions of the game have been downloaded more than 1.7 billion times and a cartoon series, available on some video-on-demand channels, has attracted more than 150 million views.
Closely held Rovio, founded in 2003, also produces the mobile games ¡°The Croods,¡± based on the DreamWorks Animation SKG movie, ¡°Tiny Thief,¡± and ¡°Icebreaker.¡±
Sony Pictures is based in Culver City, California and is owned by Tokyo-based Sony Corp. The parent¡¯s American depositary receipts fell 1.5 percent to $20.45 at the close in New York. They have gained 83 percent this year.

June 14 (Bloomberg) -- A group of online hackers identified the Federal Reserve as a target, using a video on Google Inc.¡¯s YouTube to call on Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to resign.
In the video, the group, which calls itself Anonymous, said today would mark the ¡°first step¡± of protests against Bernanke and urged those wanting him to quit to occupy a public space.
¡°The Federal Reserve¡¯s policies are systematically looting the country to enrich one 10th of 1 percent of the population,¡± a distorted voice said on the video.
The group attacked several Turkish government websites last week to protest an Internet filter it says will restrict web surfing, the Hurriyet newspaper reported. Spanish police also arrested three suspected members after the websites of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Spain¡¯s second-biggest bank, and Enel SpA, the Italian owner of Spanish power company Endesa SA, were hacked.
Anonymous also took credit for taking down the websites of Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. in December in revenge for the payment processors¡¯ decision to suspend use of their networks by WikiLeaks, an organization that publishes secret documents on its website.

March 9 (Bloomberg) -- Hector Xavier Monsegur, a hacker with the group Anonymous cooperating in a U.S. probe, won¡¯t face prosecution on charges including attempted drug-dealing and illegal gun possesion, according to a plea deal.
The agreement, made public today, stated Monsegur, 28, won¡¯t face federal charges for hacking the website of an online casino, trying to sell five pounds of marijuana, receiving stolen property and gun possession.
The U.S. also said Monsegur won¡¯t be prosecuted for using an employer¡¯s credit card to make $15,000 in unauthorized charges. The government said Monsegur¡¯s hacking activities date back to 1999. Some of the alleged criminal acts are too old to be charged or are outside federal jurisdiction, according to the agreement.
Monsegur, a former member of the Anonymous, Internet Feds and LulzSec hacker groups, began secretly cooperating with U.S. investigators after his arrest on June 7, according to a court transcript. Monsegur began working ¡°around the clock¡± to inform on his colleagues, prosecutors told a judge.
Prosecutors said in the agreement that Monsegur faces possible retaliation from the targets of his cooperation and may require federal witness protection.
Begins Cooperating
Monsegur, who pleaded guilty Aug. 15, began cooperating with U.S. authorities, including Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, after his arrest, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Pastore told U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska at a court hearing in August, according to a transcript.
Monsegur, who used the nickname Sabu and is described as an ¡°influential member¡± of all three hacker groups, admitted to staging cyber-attacks against the websites of the governments of Algeria, Yemen and Zimbabwe, according to a criminal information unsealed March 6. He also said he conducted hacks on Tribune Co. and News Corp.¡¯s Fox television, prosecutors said.
¡°Since literally the day he was arrested, the defendant has been cooperating with the government proactively,¡± Pastore told Preska at the Aug. 5 hearing, according to the transcript made available yesterday. ¡°The defendant has literally worked around the clock with federal agents. He has been staying up sometimes all night engaging in conversations with co-conspirators that are helping the government to build cases against those co-conspirators.¡±
Computer Crimes
Monsegur was charged with computer crimes by U.S. prosecutors in five districts in four states, court records show. During the two months after his arrest, he provided the U.S. with valuable information, Pastore said. Monsegur continued to work with Anonymous until last week, Barrett Brown, an informal Anonymous spokesman, said March 6.
He helped identify and ¡°patch¡± or notify potential targets about more than 150 cyber-security vulnerabilities. The FBI had sometimes even been able to alert the would-be victim of an attack before it occurred, Pastore said.
¡°The defendant¡¯s information is also helping the government close in on several prominent cybercriminals,¡± Pastore said.
Monsegur, who is cooperating in hopes of leniency, faces more than 122 years in prison, with a mandatory minimum of two years, according to prosecutors.
Lives in Manhattan
Monsegur has been unemployed since April 2010, lives in Manhattan and supports two nieces, ages 7 and 5, the documents show. He earned $6,000 a month at his previous job, which wasn¡¯t described, according to court records.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara¡¯s office revealed Monsegur¡¯s role as a cooperator this week as it announced the arrest of five other men linked to Anonymous and offshoot groups in the underground hacking movement.
¡°Exposure of the defendant¡¯s cooperation would jeopardize substantial ongoing investigations into the defendant¡¯s former co-conspirators, several of whom are suspected of carrying out substantial computer hacks against several businesses,¡± Pastore said in a June 8 request to seal his case file.
Monsegur¡¯s ¡°efforts have involved cooperation against targets of national and international interest,¡± Pastore told Preska at the August hearing. ¡°The defendant has already incurred a significant amount of personal risk by deciding to cooperate.¡±
Witness Protection
Prosecutors said in Monsegur¡¯s cooperation agreement that they will take any necessary steps to protect him from ¡°individuals who might use violence, force and intimidation against the defendant, his family and loved ones,¡± including their possible relocation under the U.S. Marshals Service Witness Security Program.
FBI agents arrested Monsegur at 10:15 p.m. on June 7, court records show. After an initial appearance the next day before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cott in New York, he was released on $50,000 bond and directed to remain under FBI supervision, records show.
Documents related to his case had been sealed until yesterday.
Monsegur¡¯s identity as a defendant remained secret because if hackers learned he had been arrested and was cooperating, he would be in danger, Pastore said in a June 8 filing.
Hackers monitor federal court dockets for information about informants and would recognize Monsegur¡¯s name because his identity was already known to them, the prosecutor said.
Retaliation Methods
Some hackers retaliate against informants through a ¡°dox,¡± putting ¡°the personal identification information of a cooperator and their family members¡± online, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Christensen, a prosecutor in Los Angeles, said in court papers.
Pastore told Preska that hackers had other ways of retaliating. For example, they might have hundreds of pizzas delivered to the cooperator¡¯s house or report a hostage situation and have a SWAT team sent to the cooperator¡¯s home.
¡°It¡¯s actually called ¡®swatting,¡¯¡± Pastore said.
Ryan Ackroyd, Jake Davis, Darren Martyn and Donncha O¡¯Cearrbhail were charged in an indictment unsealed March 6 in Manhattan federal court. They are accused of conspiracy and a variety of cyber-attacks tied to Monsegur.
A fifth man, Jeremy Hammond, who identified himself as a member of AntiSec, was arrested in Chicago March 5 and charged with the December hack of Austin, Texas-based intelligence firm Stratfor, which the U.S. says might have affected 860,000 victims. Hammond has been transferred to the custody of federal prosecutors in New York to face the charges.
The hackers charged by Bharara¡¯s office are among the de facto leadership of Anonymous, the self-professed hacker-activist group, and LulzSec, or Lulz Security, an affiliated group, U.S. authorities said.
U.S. authorities said there could be more than 1 million people who were victimized by the defendants¡¯ activities.
The case is U.S. v. Monsegur, 11-cr-666, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Dec. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Four hackers from the online group ¡°Anonymous¡± were convicted of conspiring to attack the websites of Visa Inc., PayPal Inc., MasterCard Inc. and others.
Christopher Weatherhead was found guilty today and three of his co-defendants -- Jake Birchall, Ashley Rhodes and Peter Gibson -- pleaded guilty earlier at a London criminal court to conspiring to impair the operation of computers, the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement today.
¡°Weatherhead is a cyber-criminal who waged a sophisticated and orchestrated campaign of online attacks on the computer systems of several major companies,¡± said Russell Tyner, a lawyer from the prosecutors¡¯ organized crime division.
The four also targeted the British Recorded Music Industry, Ministry of Sound and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, prosecutors said. The attacks cost the companies more than 3.5 million pounds ($5.6 million) in extra staffing, software and sales losses.
U.K. police have been investigating ¡°hacktivist¡± collectives Anonymous and LulzSec for conducting denial-of-service attacks, which flood computer networks with requests for information until they shut down.

121,"¡®Another Day, Another Scandal¡¯ as Irish Bankers Exit","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Anglo Irish Bank Corp.¡¯s decline last year cost the jobs of its chairman, chief executive officer and Ireland¡¯s financial regulator. Today, it spelled the end for three top executives at rival Irish Life & Permanent Plc.
Chief Executive Officer Denis Casey resigned from Irish Life amid a controversy over transfers of funds between the two lenders, the company said in a statement today. The decision followed the departures of Finance Director Peter Fitzpatrick and treasury head David Gantly after a board meeting last night.
¡°Another day, another scandal,¡± said Brian Lucey, associate professor in finance at Trinity College Dublin. ¡°I guess international investors are getting used to hearing the unbelievable out of Ireland.¡±
The integrity of the country¡¯s financial industry may be at stake. The scandal is hampering efforts by Ireland to shore up confidence in its ailing banking system. The government agreed this week to inject 7 billion euros ($9 billion) into its two biggest banks, though analysts say they may need more.
These issues ¡°affect investors willingness to put their money into a jurisdiction where telling the truth seems to be not a high priority among some companies,¡± said Niamh Brennan, a professor of management at University College Dublin. ¡°It begs the question, is this widespread?¡±
On Sept. 30, the last day of Dublin-based Anglo Irish¡¯s fiscal year, Irish Life across town deposited 4 billion euros overnight with Anglo, the company said.
That transfer was made after Anglo deposited the same amount ¡°as collateral¡± with Irish Life, the company said. Similar transactions amounting to 3.45 billion euros took place earlier in the month.
¡®Enron-style Accounting¡¯
¡°It may well have created a false impression about the deposit base,¡± Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told national radio yesterday. ¡°Clearly the transaction wasn¡¯t desirable because it involved the use of the bank¡¯s own money going out of the bank and back into the bank in a different guise.¡±
¡°Unacceptable¡± practices at Anglo emerged before it was nationalized last month, Lenihan said. Joan Burton, finance spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, called the transfers ¡°Enron-style accounting.¡±
The transactions were ¡°properly accounted for and fully disclosed to the financial regulator,¡± Irish Life said.
The company also said that while the financial regulator had indicated that lenders should ¡°support each other,¡± the board expressed ¡°strong disapproval¡± of the measures used to help Anglo.
¡®Mistakes Were Made¡¯
¡°I have absolutely no doubt about the integrity of the individuals concerned,¡± Chairman Gillian Bowler said in the statement. ¡°However in providing support to the broader financial infrastructure, mistakes were made - for which I and the board apologize unreservedly.¡±
Anglo Irish Chairman Donal O¡¯Connor said in a statement today that the board has begun a ¡°comprehensive review¡± of the transactions. The board is ¡°fully committed to ensuring that, as a state-owned bank, the highest standards of corporate governance and business ethics be observed,¡± he said.
Ireland¡¯s financial regulator is continuing its investigation into the matter, it said in a separate statement.
Unraveling
Anglo Irish started unraveling in December, when former Chairman Sean Fitzpatrick resigned, saying he hadn¡¯t fully disclosed loans of more than 80 million euros from the bank. Chief Executive Officer David Drumm left a day later, and Financial Regulator Pat Neary stepped down last month after it emerged his agency had known about the loans.
The government moved to seize control of Anglo Irish after Fitzpatrick, 60, said in a Dec. 18 statement he had temporarily transferred borrowings to another bank before each year-end, moving them off Anglo¡¯s books.
¡°This is the real damage that¡¯s been done, the reputational damage to the country¡¯s financial system by the unethical practices that have come to light,¡± Lenihan said.
Ireland¡¯s five-member ISEF financial index plunged 94 percent over the past year, compared with a 65 percent drop in the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.
Eugene Sheehy, CEO at Allied Irish Banks Plc, the largest bank, said the case of Anglo Irish was ¡°disappointing and caused problems¡± for Ireland¡¯s reputation.
¡°But you can¡¯t tar everybody with the same brush,¡± Sheehy said in an interview yesterday by telephone. ¡°There are institutions in Ireland operating to the highest standards.¡±
The government on Feb. 11 announced plans to inject 3.5 billion euros each into Allied Irish and Bank of Ireland Plc, seeking to cushion the impact of surging bad debts.
Earlier, the government had planned to inject 2 billion euros and underwrite a further 1 billion euros of shares for each bank. It scrapped that plan as banks couldn¡¯t find willing investors as the economy lurched deeper into crisis.
Now the latest revelations have overshadowed efforts to restore the banking system, said Joan Burton, the Labour lawmaker, in a Feb. 10 statement. ¡°Ireland¡¯s international reputation continues to be severely undermined.¡±"

June 8 (Bloomberg) -- Investors¡¯ negativity towards the euro has created an ¡°anti-bubble¡± of sentiment that overstates prospects for a breakup of the currency, which may rebound to $1.30, Schneider Foreign Exchange said.
¡°Although the single currency could very well fall further, it is our opinion that further euro sales should not be triggered by break-up or euro-sustainability fears,¡± Stephen Gallo, head of market analysis at Schneider in London, said in an e-mailed note. ¡°We stick with our view that euro-dollar fair value is in the $1.30-$1.35 range, although we confess that it may take a considerable period of time for that range to come back into play.¡±
Cooperation among European nations is stronger today than it was before the euro was introduced in 1999, he wrote.

May 5 (Bloomberg) -- Europe¡¯s debt crisis may spur global central banks to shift their reserve holdings from the euro to Canada¡¯s loonie and the Australian dollar, according to BlueGold Capital Management LLP¡¯s Stephen Jen.
¡°As the euro trades lower, central banks, especially those that have been aggressively diversifying away from the dollar into the euro, they must be worried,¡± Jen, a managing director in London at the hedge-fund firm and former head of global currency research at Morgan Stanley, said at a Euromoney conference in London. Central bank reserve managers will seek ¡°anti-euros out there,¡± Jen said.
The euro has fallen against all of its 16 most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg during the past 12 months, dropping 21 percent against the Australian dollar and 16 percent versus the loonie on concern indebted members of the European Union including Greece and Spain are struggling to finance their budget deficits.
Australia and Canada have liquid markets, ¡°credible¡± central banks and ¡°clean national balance sheets,¡± Jen said.
Their appeal to central banks is one reason why the Aussie and loonie ¡°can rally from a structural perspective in addition to the cyclical considerations related to China and the commodity cycle,¡± Jen said.
Canada gets about half its export revenue from raw materials, while China is Australia¡¯s largest trading partner. The Canadian currency is known as the loonie for the image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin.
Central banks reduced the share of euros in their $8.1 trillion of reserves to 27.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 from 28 percent in the previous three months, according to Morgan Stanley calculations based on International Monetary Fund figures. The figure was about 17 percent when the euro was introduced 11 years ago.

June 28 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. banks are likely to reduce assets to meet planned capital requirements that are akin to an ¡°antitrust action,¡± said Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC.
¡°The central bankers want to limit the growth or break up the western world¡¯s largest banks,¡± Bove, who is based in Lutz, Florida, wrote today in a note to clients. ¡°Once the new regulations are out, the big banks will shrink.¡±
Banks deemed too big to fail may be required to hold 2.5 percentage points in additional capital as part of efforts to prevent another financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said June 25. That buffer would rise to 3.5 percentage points for lenders that grow even larger, it said.
Banks won¡¯t sell stock to raise capital because they currently trade below their book value, Bove wrote. The idea that lenders will retain profits and wait to meet capital requirements that take full effect in 2019 also ¡°makes no sense,¡± in part because other regulations may impede earnings,
¡°The central bankers have claimed that these targeted institutions are undercapitalized,¡± Bove wrote. ¡°This should impact their cost of borrowing. They cannot wait eight years to address the problem.¡±

125,¡®Anything Goes¡¯ for $252 as Broadway Premium Ticket Sales Grow,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- New York¡¯s tax-exempt theaters with Broadway houses have shied away from charging ¡°premium¡± prices for choice seats at hit shows. They¡¯ve left that to their commercial competitors.
Until now.
Roundabout Theatre Co., enjoying its biggest hit in a decade with the Broadway revival of ¡°Anything Goes,¡± increased the top ticket price in June to $252, 84 percent more than the regular orchestra-seat price of $137.
The Roundabout isn¡¯t alone. Earlier in the year, as ¡°God of Carnage¡± starring James Gandolfini broke box office records at Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles, it raised its top ticket price 66 percent to $200.
Introduced in 2001 for ¡°The Producers,¡± premium seats allow commercial producers to legally tap into the secondary market that used to be the domain of illegal scalpers. They give deep-pocketed buyers instant access to the best seats at the hottest shows, and enhance revenue and profit in an industry where investors typically lose money.
First Time
Now, more and more nonprofit theaters are following suit. In its first-ever offering of premium tickets, the Roundabout sets aside about 30 center orchestra seats per performance at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre for ¡°Anything Goes.¡± The Royal Shakespeare Company charged as much as $250 for tickets during its recent New York engagement at the Park Avenue Armory.
Premium seats were also sold for ¡°Hair¡± and ¡°The Merchant of Venice.¡± Both were first produced by the Public Theater, which moved them to Broadway jointly with commercial producers. The Kennedy Center¡¯s acclaimed revival of ¡°Follies,¡± which recently opened on Broadway, offers premium seats for $225.
A Roundabout spokesman, Jessica Johnson, said in an e-mail that box office income helps fund Roundabout programs for developing new work, arts education in New York City public schools and commissions for writers.
At Center Theatre Group, premium seats are part of ¡°dynamic pricing,¡± in which prices rise or fall during a show¡¯s run, based on demand.
Funding New Work
¡°The people buying these tickets are underwriting our discounts,¡± said Michael Ritchie, artistic director of Center Theatre Group, which operates the Ahmanson Theatre, the Mark Taper Forum and the Kirk Douglas Theatre. ¡°There is no profit that gets skimmed off into our pockets. Premium prices pay for the mission.¡±
Both Center Theatre Group and Roundabout sell tickets as cheap as $20. (The Roundabout offers some $10 tickets to previews.) Additionally, New York¡¯s three TKTS outlets, operated by the nonprofit Theatre Development Fund, offer 50 percent off on most ¡°Anything Goes¡± performances.
Ben Cameron, who helps dispense $13 million annually as the program director for the arts at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, said high prices are fine so long as cheaper ones are also available.
¡°In a climate where subsidies are so minimal, organizations have to maximize revenues where they can,¡± he said.
Roundabout¡¯s Broadway rivals don¡¯t necessarily agree. The top ticket for Lincoln Center Theater¡¯s ¡°War Horse,¡± a sentimental equine drama set in the World War I era, remains $135 even in the wake of winning the Tony Award for best play.
At Odds
Administrators discussed introducing premium pricing, Lincoln Center Theater spokesman Philip Rinaldi said.
¡°We have decided against it for philosophical reasons,¡± he said in an e-mail, declining to elaborate.
Similarly, Manhattan Theatre Club, another nonprofit, ¡°will not be selling premium seating tickets at the Friedman,¡± its Broadway house, MTC executive producer Barry Grove said in an e-mail.
Both companies have mitigating factors the Roundabout lacks. The Friedman hasn¡¯t housed a long-running hit on the order of ¡°Anything Goes.¡±
Lincoln Center Theater had a $76 million endowment in June 2010 -- five times that of the Roundabout, according to the companies¡¯ tax returns. LCT pays below-market maintenance to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts for office space and two theaters. It had a $19 million surplus in 2009-2010, while the Roundabout, with five theaters, ran a $3.4 million deficit.
Todd Haimes, the Roundabout¡¯s artistic director, declined to comment. In an earlier interview with Bloomberg, he said he¡¯d consider premium prices for a show that extends beyond its initial run for subscribers.
Nix Scalpers
¡°I¡¯m not philosophically against that because frankly I would rather the producers -- whether it¡¯s Roundabout or a commercial producer -- get the money than a ticket scalper,¡± Haimes said.
It¡¯s not just the producer who sees that extra cash. ¡°Anything Goes¡± increased prices partly to offset higher labor costs after the show extended beyond its initial 12-week run, said Johnson, the spokesman. The Roundabout contract with Actors¡¯ Equity Association calls for the minimum performer salary to increase from $1,231 to $1,653 after the extension.

May 7 (Bloomberg) -- When Lincoln was nominated for president, he was a former one-term congressman and a failed Senate candidate from Illinois. A self-made man, he came to represent the promise of democracy.
(To listen to the podcast, click here.)
By the time the Rail-Splitter was elected, seven states had seceded and the country was on the brink of war. Remaining in Springfield, Illinois, before assuming office, Lincoln was often lampooned in the press. One cartoon in Harper¡¯s Weekly showed him drinking and laughing as a funeral cortege passed by -- the coffin was labeled ¡°Constitution¡± and ¡°Union.¡±
On his way to Washington, it didn¡¯t help when in Indianapolis he made a bawdy reference to the ¡°free-love arrangement¡± envisioned by the secessionists. After an optimistic speech in Columbus, Ohio, he was denounced as a ¡°clown.¡±
It was not until his brilliant July 4, 1861, address to Congress showing the profound threat to democracy secession represented that President Lincoln came into his own. Though he was reviled for political reasons, after that hardly anyone called him an ¡°ape¡± or a ¡°rube.¡±

127,¡®Apes¡¯ Is Top Film for Second Weekend With $27.8 Million,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 15 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Rise of the Planet of the Apes,¡± the prequel to the 1968 classic, remained the top movie in U.S. and Canadian theaters for a second weekend, with $27.8 million in ticket sales for News Corp.¡¯s Twentieth Century Fox.
¡°The Help,¡± the civil rights-era drama from Walt Disney Co. and Steven Spielberg¡¯s DreamWorks Studios SKG, was second with $26 million, researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed statement ¡°Final Destination 5¡± opened third with sales of $18 million.
¡°Rise of the Planets of the Apes¡± outdrew four new movies opening this past weekend. The picture revives the franchise that began with the original film based on the Pierre Boulle novel about a world where the roles of apes and humans are reversed. Six previous movies derived from Boulle¡¯s concept have generated $691.3 million in domestic ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo, another industry tracker.
¡°It¡¯s a solid second weekend for ¡®Rise of the Planet of the Apes,¡¯¡± said Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo. ¡°It couldn¡¯t realistically have expected much more, based on where it was at last weekend.¡± The film had $54.8 million in receipts then.
¡°Rise of the Planet of the Apes,¡± featuring James Franco, is the first picture from Chernin Entertainment, led by former News Corp. President and Chief Operating Officer Peter Chernin. Chernin, 60, resigned from News Corp. in 2009 to open the movie and TV production company. The film has taken in $105.2 million in the U.S. and Canada since it opened Aug. 5.
¡®The Help¡¯
In the movie, a chimp used in drug tests is endowed with high intelligence. He leads a rebellion against harsh treatment in the lab, setting the stage for the role reversal of humans and apes explored in the original picture. Franco plays a sympathetic scientist who treats the young chimp with kindness.
Tom Felton, who played Draco Malfoy in the ¡°Harry Potter¡± films, co-stars as one of the chimp¡¯s antagonists. The cast also includes Freida Pinto and John Lithgow. The effects-heavy movie cost about $90 million to make, according to the Internet Movie Database. The website Boxoffice.com had forecast $26 million in sales for the movie¡¯s second weekend.
¡°The Help¡± stars Emma Stone as an aspiring journalist who writes about the experiences of black maids in racially segregated Mississippi. Set in the early 1960s, the film explores relations between middle-class white women and the blacks who work in their homes.
¡®Final Destination 5¡¯
Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis co-star as the black women who cope with mixed emotions caring for their employers¡¯ white children while enduring thoughtless insults from the mothers. The film has taken in $35.9 million since opening on Aug. 10.
In ¡°Final Destination 5,¡± from Time Warner Inc.¡¯s Warner Bros., a group of humans escape a bridge collapse only to be pursued by death. The first four films in the horror series took in $507.2 million in worldwide ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo.
¡°¡®Final Destination 5¡¯ had a disappointing debut,¡± Gray said, adding this was the first time a ¡°Final Destination¡± sequel had a lower opening than its predecessor. The movie ¡°simply promised more of the same without any new twists.¡±
Sony Corp.¡¯s ¡°The Smurfs¡± dropped to fourth place from second, with revenue of $13.7 million. Combining live action and computer effects, ¡°The Smurfs¡± stars Neil Patrick Harris as a New Yorker who helps the tiny, blue creatures after they are forced from their village by an evil wizard.
¡®Glee¡¯
¡°30 Minutes or Less,¡± also by Sony, opened in fifth place with $13.3 million in sales. The film features ¡°The Social Network¡± star Jesse Eisenberg as a pizza-delivery man who is ordered by criminals to rob a bank. They strap a bomb to his torso to make sure he carries out the plot. Aziz Ansari co-stars as a friend who is recruited to help out.
¡°Glee: The 3-D Concert Movie,¡± a musical drama based on the Fox television series, was the fourth debut this past weekend. It opened in 11th place with $6 million in receipts. The ranking is due in part to moviegoers judging the film to be little different from the television show, Gray said.
¡°It falls under the adage, ¡®Why pay for something that¡¯s free on TV?¡± Gray said. ¡°On top of that, you¡¯re not getting anything really new or essential to the show if you¡¯re a fan.¡±
Weekend revenue for the top 12 films rose 8.2 percent to $143 million from a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Domestic box-office sales this year have declined 4.2 percent to $6.93 billion, while attendance is down 5.1 percent.

128,"¡®App-Crazy¡¯ U.S. Banks Follow Customers to iPads, Smartphones","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 16 (Bloomberg) -- As consumers manage more of their lives with smartphones and Apple Inc.¡¯s iPads, financial-services companies are trying to ensure they don¡¯t get lost in the electronic shuffle.
¡°The industry right now is app-crazy,¡± says James McGovern, vice-president for consulting services at Corporate Insight, which monitors how banks communicate with customers.
¡°We¡¯re just going where the customers are,¡± says Christopher Larkin, E*Trade Financial Corp.¡¯s senior vice president for active trading.
Bank of America Corp.¡¯s online brokerage, Merrill Edge, is even exploring the idea of face-to-face teleconferencing between clients and advisers through the mobile apps it unveiled on March 9, says Alok Prasad, who heads the division, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.
Forrester Research Inc. estimates that more than 10 million Americans use mobile-banking technology and that the number could rise to 50 million by 2015. About 75 percent of those using the technology now are members of generations X and Y, according to Forrester.
While many of those consumers are comfortable using mobile apps to check their balances, companies need to work themselves more deeply into a mobile customer¡¯s financial life or the work that goes into developing all of these mobile apps may wind up being ¡°another cost center,¡± says Gartner Inc. analyst Stessa Cohen.
¡®Smart Decisions¡¯
The ¡°real potential¡± for mobile personal-finance apps may come from linking investments and savings with spending in real time, says Ron Shevlin, senior analyst at the research firm Aite Group. Apps could track consumers¡¯ spending and investments while offering ¡°personal finance management¡± by maintaining budgets and helping consumers ¡°make smart decisions about how to finance a purchase,¡± he says.
To do that, financial outfits have to get in on the front end of spending decisions. Lenders including Wells Fargo & Co. and Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America have been testing mobile-payment systems using smartphones in a small number of cities across the country.
In December, Wells Fargo started a pilot with 200 employees in San Francisco, where its headquarters are located. After a similar pilot last year, Bank of America on March 28 will start a mobile-payment test with customers in New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Just as they would swipe a credit card, shoppers hold phones up to special readers to complete purchases.
Coupons, Promotions
In addition to offering a convenient way to pay through credit- or debit-card accounts, mobile phones could deliver instant coupons and other promotions to shoppers, says Arah Erickson, head of Wells Fargo¡¯s retail mobile banking division.
If closer connections with financial institutions make it easier for consumers to see where their money goes, that could be a big positive, says Meir Statman, a professor at Santa Clara University, who specializes in behavioral finance.
Such knowledge ¡°really bolsters their self-control¡± when they¡¯re shopping, says Statman, author of ¡°What Investors Really Want.¡±
Another outcome could be less positive, though.
¡°People are more likely to trade more if it¡¯s made easier,¡± Statman says. ¡°What we know from studies is the more you trade, the more you are likely to lag behind people who buy and hold investments.¡±
Thus far, 11 percent of investors use their brokerages¡¯ mobile offerings and about a quarter of those users trade through mobile platforms, says Forrester.
Options Trading
E*Trade says about 3 percent to 4 percent of its trades are placed through mobile devices, and it will soon add trading of futures and mutual funds to its current lineup of stocks and options. TD Ameritrade has seen increased trading activity due to its mobile app, particularly in options trading, says Nicole Sherrod, managing director of the firm¡¯s trader group.
Nevertheless, she adds, the main goal is to attract customers and position the firm for future growth, not to boost trading immediately. TD Ameritrade will introduce its second iPad app in late April, she says, with this one aimed at long-term investors rather than traders.
Forrester analyst Bill Doyle doubts mobile offerings will stimulate much extra trading overall, though he does expect customers to shift holdings to companies with better mobile offerings.
¡°Mobile devices are changing consumers¡¯ perceptions of how convenient financial transactions should be,¡± says Wells Fargo¡¯s Erickson. ¡°Today, convenience means the PC is across the room, and I don¡¯t feel like booting it up.¡±

129,¡®Apple Fever¡¯ Prompts Predictions of $1 Trillion Value,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 3 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. rose to a record after two analysts said the stock could surge past $1,000 a share, putting the maker of the iPhone on a path toward becoming the first $1 trillion U.S. company.
Apple, already the world¡¯s most valuable company, climbed 1.7 percent to $629.32 in New York after analysts from Piper Jaffray Cos. and Topeka Capital Markets said demand for the iPhone and iPad, growth in China and the potential debut of a new television product would propel shares.
¡°Apple fever is spreading like a wildfire around the world,¡± Brian White, the Topeka analyst, said in a report that initiated coverage of the company with a buy recommendation.
White¡¯s new 12-month target of $1,001 is the highest among the 45 analysts tracked by Bloomberg and represents a 59 percent increase over today¡¯s closing price. He said Apple¡¯s market value will eventually top $1 trillion.
Gene Munster, the Piper Jaffray analyst, said a prolonged stock surge will be boosted by the introduction of a new iPhone.
¡°Shares can reach $1,000 based on our belief that Apple will continue to win in global mobile devices,¡± Munster wrote in a note, predicting that the stock can reach $1,000 in 2014. At $1,000 a share, Apple¡¯s market capitalization would be $932.4 billion.
JPMorgan Target Raised
Munster raised his 12-month price target to $910 from $718. JPMorgan Chase & Co. also raised its price target for Apple --to $715 a share, from $625.
Apple will debut a TV within a year, White predicted. The company also plans to release an upgraded iPhone that works with speedier wireless networks, he said. China Mobile Ltd., the Asian country¡¯s largest wireless network, will start carrying the iPhone in that same period, he said.
The television would create a new $100 billion market opportunity for the company, White said. China, meanwhile, offers some of the best growth prospects. Mobile-phone subscribers in the country with access to 3G wireless networks could reach 230 million by the end of this year, adding millions of new potential iPhone buyers, White said.
Some of the boost in Apple stock is a result of the relatively seamless management transition since the death of co-founder Steve Jobs, White said. The stock has risen more than 60 percent since he died in October. Tim Cook had assumed the role of chief executive officer from Jobs the previous August.
$1 Trillion in Sales
¡°Steve Jobs¡¯s health was such a fear that was hanging over the stock,¡± White said in an interview. ¡°Now you¡¯ve seen that Tim Cook is doing a good job.¡±
Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, declined to comment.
Apple¡¯s management should aim to become the first company to generate $1 trillion in revenue, a goal that¡¯s achievable in the next decade, White said. Apple had sales of $108.2 billion in its last fiscal year, which ended in September.
A risk for Apple is the uncertainty over who will make critical decisions about future products, White said. Cook¡¯s experience is with Apple¡¯s supply chain and operations, and less with product development, the area where Jobs excelled.
The stock has risen 55 percent this year, spurred by soaring iPhone revenue and the debut of a higher-resolution iPad last month. Apple¡¯s market value is $586.8 billion, far above the previous leader, Exxon Mobil Corp., which is valued at $404.5 billion.
Dividend, Buyback
Apple investors also are benefiting from a $2.65-a-share dividend, starting in July, and a $10 billion stock buyback plan. The company announced both initiatives last month.
White previously covered Apple for Ticonderoga Securities LLC, where his last price target was $666. The next closest prediction to the new projection is Munster¡¯s, at $910.
White said Apple can hit his target because its iPhone and Mac computers still have relatively low market share, giving them room to grow. He also foresees Apple introducing iPads with a smaller screen size, letting them compete more directly with tablet computers from Amazon.com Inc. and other rivals.
PetroChina Co. was the world¡¯s first company to be valued at $1 trillion, achieved on its first day of trading in Shanghai in November 2007. The company¡¯s current market value is about $280 billion.

130,¡®Apple Peel¡¯ Inventors Defend Device Turning IPod Into IPhone,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Pan Lei and Pan Yong, the Chinese brothers who invented a device to convert Apple Inc.¡¯s iPod Touch into an iPhone, say they are innovators, not copycats.
Their Apple Peel 520 is a case including a circuit board and battery that wraps around the iPod Touch media player, allowing calls to be made after software is installed. The device, which requires breaking into Apple¡¯s operating system, isn¡¯t a counterfeit iPhone, Pan Lei, 25, told Bloomberg Television.
¡°We¡¯re capable of coming up with something original,¡± Pan Lei, who quit his job as an interior designer to found Shenzhen, China-based Yosion Technology Co. with his 23-year-old software-engineer brother, said in an interview broadcast today.
The iPod music player has sold more than 220 million units since it was first released in 2001, according to the company. Apple first released its iPhone in 2007, climbing to 2.7 percent of the global market by June this year and sparking copycat models from Chinese grey market, or Shanzhai, vendors.
¡°The brothers who invented this Apple Peel probably ran down a list of how many ways could they annoy Steve Jobs,¡± said Jonathan Hudis, chairman of the American Bar Association¡¯s Trademarks and Unfair Competition Division. ¡°I could not see Apple standing by to let this continue, especially if it results in product shipping into the United States.¡±
U.S. users can save at least $770 by using the device to be priced at $60. Jill Tan, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Apple, said any product that¡¯s been tampered with won¡¯t receive warranty support. Apple is aware of Apple Peel, she said, declining to comment further.
¡°Very Creative¡±
Apple Peel sells for 520 yuan ($78) on Taobao.com, China¡¯s largest online shopping site. Yosion agreed to offer the device in the U.S. with New Orleans-based Go Solar USA Inc., whose website teaches users to ¡°jailbreak¡± the iPod Touch in preparation for installing Apple Peel software.
U.S. users must sign a two-year contract with AT&T Inc. for the iPhone, paying at least $39.99 a month and $99 for the iPhone 3GS, or a total of $1,059. The iPod Touch sells from $229.
¡°We¡¯re also very creative,¡± Pan Lei said. ¡°Not just getting a Nokia phone and copy, getting Apple and copy, or a Samsung phone to copy as well. It shouldn¡¯t be like that.¡±

April 12 (Bloomberg) -- Alan Sugar, chairman of Amshold Securities Ltd., won an employment dispute filed by a woman who said she had been unfairly fired from the job she obtained from winning the U.K. version of ¡°The Apprentice.¡±
A London tribunal unanimously ruled Stella English, who won the reality-TV show in 2010, resigned from her 100,000 pound-a-year-job ($153,730) at Viglen Ltd.
¡°I have been cleared of a derisory attempt to smear my name and extract money from me,¡± Sugar, the businessman who is the star of the program, said in a press release posted on Twitter. ¡°I¡¯m afraid she underestimated me and her reputation is now in tatters.¡±
Philippa Jackson, a lawyer for English, didn¡¯t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.

132,¡®Apprentice¡¯ Star Sugar Urges Londoners Not to Back Livingstone,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 19 (Bloomberg) -- Alan Sugar, one of the U.K. Labour Party¡¯s best-known supporters, urged voters not to support its candidate for London Mayor, Ken Livingstone, at next month¡¯s election.
Sugar, who stars in the British version of ¡°The Apprentice¡± reality television series and was given a seat in the House of Lords by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, made the comments today on his verified Twitter Inc. account. His spokesman, Andrew Bloch, confirmed they were genuine.
The Amshold Group Ltd. chairman, who made his fortune selling consumer electronics, gave more than 69,000 pounds ($111,000) to Labour last year, including donating directly to leader Ed Miliband¡¯s office, according to the Electoral Commission. That made him one of the party¡¯s most generous individual supporters.
¡°Livingstone must NOT get in,¡± Sugar, 65, wrote. ¡°I don¡¯t care if Ed Miliband is backing Livingstone. I seriously suggest NO ONE votes for Livingstone in the mayoral elections.¡±
While Sugar did not explicitly endorse incumbent Mayor Boris Johnson, his comments will help the Conservative, who is seeking re-election on May 3.
Johnson had 53 percent support compared with 47 percent for Livingstone in a choice between the two, according to a ComRes Ltd. poll published in the Evening Standard newspaper April 10.
Livingstone was the first person to win election as mayor when the post was established in 2000 and had the job for two terms before losing to Johnson in 2008.
The race has been dominated recently by a dispute in a broadcast debate on April 3 in which Johnson accused Livingstone of being a liar as they argued over whether either had avoided tax.

133,"G-8, International Lenders Mobilize $38 Billion for Arab Spring","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Western and Middle Eastern governments pledged to help Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Jordan make the transition to democracy, mobilizing $38 billion of financing, mostly through international lending organizations.
The four countries presented national action plans to develop their economies at a meeting yesterday in Marseille, France. Libya sent representatives to the gathering, hoping eventually to join the so-called Deauville Partnership.
The aid is intended to support economies and create jobs as the countries undertake the delicate process of opening up their political systems and holding free elections. The political changes have hurt tourism and investment, at the same time unleashing expectations of better lives.
¡°We are facing an historical transformational moment, and while there are downsides, there¡¯s enormous enthusiasm,¡± International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said after the meeting. ¡°It has to be focused on job creation, especially for the young people.¡±
Lagarde said the fund now recognizes the National Transitional Council as holding Libya¡¯s IMF seat, and she¡¯ll soon send a team to the North African country.
The amount mobilized is up from the $20 billion that was promised at a May meeting of Group of Eight government heads in Deauville, France, which gave its name to the partnership.
More Partners
Morocco and Jordan have joined initial members Tunisia and Egypt since the initiative was launched at the Normandy resort. Representatives from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, as well as nine international lenders, including the World Bank, the IMF and the African Development Bank, joined yesterday¡¯s meeting.
¡°What¡¯s the novelty is that there are many more partners around the table,¡± Lagarde said. ¡°We have donors from international and regional institutions that are engaged in the region.¡±
French Finance Minister Francois Baroin didn¡¯t give details of the national action plans, and no Arab leaders spoke after the meeting.
The plans ¡°demonstrate a clear and shared commitment to enhanced prosperity for their people supported by the objectives set out in the Deauville declaration: to strengthen governance, foster economic and social inclusion, create jobs and support private sector-led growth,¡± the final G-8 declaration said.
Increased Funding
Libya was an observer at the Marseille meeting. French officials say the new Libyan administration must be in full control of their country and fully recognized as the legal government before it¡¯s inducted into the partnership.
British Finance Minister George Osborne said member states would increase the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development¡¯s lending power to boost its financing in the southern rim of the Mediterranean.
¡°We want to get some money to the EBRD so it can get going without formal notification, and also a significant bringing together of the resources from all the other development banks,¡± he said. International lenders could mobilize ¡°tens of billions of dollars¡± for Arab Spring nations, he said.
Osborne also said he wants expanded trade in the Middle East and for the EBRD ¡°to play a similar role in supporting this region today as it did in the former Soviet bloc countries following the fall of the Berlin wall a quarter of a century ago.¡±
Funding Breakdown
The European Investment Bank said in a statement that it will lend $7.5 billion to the four member countries through 2013, with $3 billion to Egypt alone. It said it will focus on projects that will create jobs, including microfinance, transport infrastructure and social housing.
The World Bank said it would finance $10.7 billion of projects, the ADB $7.6 billion and the Islamic Development Bank $5 billion. Baroin said French assistance would amount to $2.7 billion.
Tunisia is seeking $25 billion in assistance from abroad in the next five years to support its economy and tackle unemployment, Finance Minister Jaloul Ayed said in an interview on Sept. 7.
Tunisia and Egypt have yet to receive more than a fraction of the aid pledged by western and Arab governments to support their transition to democracy, the Financial Times reported on Sept. 9, citing the two nations¡¯ finance chiefs.
Egyptian Finance Minister Hazem el Beblawi said the country had received just $500 million of $7 billion promised by the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, though discussions on the remaining funds were ongoing and he expects an agreement by the end of the year, the FT said.
The kings of Jordan and Morocco have announced steps to allow more democratic representation. In Libya, dictators Muammar Qaddafi was overthrown after a six-month conflict in which North Atlantic Treaty Organization fighter jets backed rebel forces.

March 13 (Bloomberg) -- New Zealand diplomats visited American hostages portrayed in actor and director Ben Affleck¡¯s Oscar-winning film ¡°Argo¡± and gave them beer, contrary to the rebuff suggested in the movie, said one of the escapees.
Chris Beeby and Richard Sewell met the six U.S. embassy workers ¡°a number of times¡± while they sheltered in a Canadian official¡¯s house during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis and helped raise their spirits, Lee Schatz said in an interview. Beeby bought them at least one case of beer at Christmas time, after asking Schatz if there was anything special they needed. New Zealand¡¯s parliament yesterday criticized the film for suggesting the nation turned the U.S. diplomats away.
¡°I have fond memories of those two gentlemen,¡± said Schatz, 65, by telephone. ¡°If they were still alive I would have called them up and said hey, this sucks.¡±
New Zealand¡¯s two-man bureau in Iran didn¡¯t have the capability to shelter the hostages, and Sewell went to the departure lounge at the airport on the Americans¡¯ last day in Iran to make sure they escaped, Schatz said.
¡°Everyone who touched us in those weeks and months put themselves in danger,¡± said Schatz. ¡°It was diplomats in a modern time doing some really, really, heroic things -- and I don¡¯t use that term easily.¡±
¡®Didn¡¯t Fit¡¯
Affleck directed and starred in ¡°Argo,¡± which won Best Picture at this year¡¯s Academy Awards and depicts the rescue of six U.S. Embassy workers during the Iranian revolution. They posed as a film crew to escape the country.
Schatz, played by actor Rory Cochrane in the film, wasn¡¯t involved in making ¡°Argo,¡± he said. On first viewing the film, he saw some things ¡°that didn¡¯t fit¡± and on a second viewing thought ¡°OK, it¡¯s a movie. Let¡¯s watch it. And it was good entertainment,¡± he said.
New Zealand law-makers yesterday passed a motion ¡°expressing regret¡± about the film¡¯s depiction of its diplomats. The motion, tabled by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, said the movie misled the world and the nation deserved a correct and factual record.
¡°Instantly you felt like these were people that you knew, and you liked knowing,¡± Schatz said of the New Zealand diplomats. ¡°They were friends.¡±

135,¡®Argo¡¯ Is Top Weekend Film With $12.1 Million in Receipts,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Argo,¡± Ben Affleck¡¯s thriller about the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, jumped to first place in its third weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters, taking in $12.1 million for Time Warner Inc.¡¯s Warner Bros.
¡°Cloud Atlas,¡± also from Warner Bros., was second, collecting $9.6 million in its opening weekend, researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed statement.
¡°Argo,¡± considered a probable Oscar nominee, benefited from word-of-mouth recommendations and a weak slate of new pictures entering theaters. Affleck produced and directed the film and plays the lead character. The movie is based on the true story of a mission by the CIA and Canadian diplomats to sneak six Americans out of Iran after the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in 1979.
¡°First, people are loving the film and recommending it to their friends, and second, the four new movies opening this weekend mostly crashed and burned,¡± Gitesh Pandya, editor of BoxOfficeGuru.com in New York, said in a telephone interview. While it will probably lose the No. 1 spot to new openings starting next weekend, the film is on track to gross more than $100 million, driven in part by ¡°Oscar buzz,¡± he said.
¡°Argo¡± is a five-to-one favorite to win the Academy Award for best picture, according to GoldDerby.com, a website that compiles forecasts by journalists who cover the Oscars. Affleck also is favored to win the best director award, according to the website. The film has generated $60.5 million in ticket sales since opening on Oct. 12.
¡®Cloud Atlas¡¯
¡°Cloud Atlas,¡± a series of interwoven stories that play out over several centuries, is based on the novel by U.K. author David Mitchell. The film stars Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Hugh Grant. It was directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski, makers of the ¡°Matrix¡± films, and by Tom Tykwer.
¡°It¡¯s a disappointing opening, but it was a very tough movie to sell in the first place,¡± Pandya said, citing the multiple storylines that take place across 500 years. ¡°It¡¯s very difficult for marketers to get the message across as to what the story is because it is very complex.¡±
Among returning films, Sony Corp.¡¯s ¡°Hotel Transylvania¡± was third with receipts of $9.4 million. The animated film features the voice of Adam Sandler as Dracula, who invites famous monsters to celebrate his daughter¡¯s birthday.
¡°Paranormal Activity 4,¡± the latest installment in Paramount Pictures¡¯ low-cost horror series, fell to fourth from first place with sales of $8.5 million.
¡®Silent Hill¡¯
Like its predecessors, ¡°Paranormal Activity 4¡± is filmed in the ¡°found-footage¡± style, as characters set up cameras to record strange happenings when no one is around. In this edition, a neighborhood becomes the setting for terrifying events after a woman and a mysterious child move in.
The debut film ¡°Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,¡± from Open Road Films, was fifth with $8 million. Adelaide Clemens stars as a young woman who is drawn into a demonic world with little hope of escape. Sean Bean also is featured in the film.
¡°Taken 2,¡± from Fox, was sixth with $7.7 million. The film is a sequel to the 2009 Liam Neeson action film.
¡°Fun Size,¡± from Viacom Inc.¡¯s Paramount Pictures, opened in 10th place with sales of $4.1 million. The comedy follows a teen-age girl assigned to keep track of her little brother on Halloween night. The movie features Chelsea Handler, Victoria Justice and Johnny Knoxville.
Weekend revenue for the top 12 films fell 13 percent to $81.2 million from the year-earlier period, Hollywood.com said. Domestic film sales this year have risen 3.8 percent to $8.7 billion, with attendance up 2.6 percent.
Hurricane Sandy may have caused sales to decline on the East Coast in a period that¡¯s already weak before holiday releases that begin the first weekend of November, Pandya said.
The amounts below are based on actual ticket sales from Oct. 26 to Oct. 28.

136,¡®Argo¡¯ Wins Best Film Bafta; Affleck Named Best Director,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 11 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Argo,¡± the story of a stealth mission to rescue a group of U.S. hostages from Iran in 1980, was voted best film at the British Academy Film Awards, or Baftas, last night. Its director Ben Affleck also won.
¡°Argo¡± had picked up prizes in the exact same categories at the Golden Globes in January. It is now one of nine contenders for best picture at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awards, or Oscars, in Los Angeles on Feb. 24.
¡°I wanted to get as far away from Boston as I could, and ended up in Iran,¡± joked the bearded Affleck as he walked up the red carpet at London¡¯s Royal Opera House. Flanking him all evening was George Clooney, also sporting a full beard, who, as ¡°Argo¡± coproducer, won his first-ever Bafta.
The four runners-up for best film were ¡°Les Miserables,¡± an adaptation of the hit stage musical; ¡°Life of Pi,¡± the story of a man stuck on a lifeboat with a tiger; ¡°Lincoln,¡± Steven Spielberg¡¯s saga about the 16th president¡¯s abolition of slavery; and ¡°Zero Dark Thirty,¡± on the hunt for and killing of Osama Bin Laden.
Last night¡¯s other big victors were Daniel Day-Lewis, for his role as President Abraham Lincoln in Spielberg¡¯s 150-minute ¡°Lincoln;¡± and the 85-year-old French actress Emmanuelle Riva -- who won in absentia -- for her part as the bed-ridden stroke victim in Michael Haneke¡¯s ¡°Amour.¡±
Diplomats Escape
¡°Argo¡± is the true story of six U.S. diplomats who manage to escape captivity in post-revolutionary Tehran by posing as a Canadian film crew. It¡¯s based on the memoirs of CIA officer Tony Mendez (played by Affleck), who masterminded the mission.
Affleck said he initially went searching for Persian-speaking actors in Turkey until Clooney told him about the ¡°massive¡± community of first- and second-generation Iranians in L.A.
¡°There were people who were doing theater, people who were doing films, people who stepped in ready to go,¡± Affleck told reporters backstage, as coproducers Clooney and Grant Heslov stood by. ¡°We didn¡¯t have to explain anything to them.¡±
¡°Even more important and more profound was, so many people who were part of this movie had gone through the experience of fleeing Iran,¡± he said.
Affleck, who was also on the best-actor Bafta shortlist for ¡°Argo,¡± said the odds of any actor beating Day-Lewis were ¡°400,000 to one.¡±
Spielberg Request
On the podium moments earlier, Day-Lewis said he initially turned away Spielberg because he didn¡¯t feel compelled to impersonate the 16th U.S. president.
¡°At the time when he first presented it to me, not only did I not feel that need, but I thought quite positively that that would be a wonderful thing for somebody else to do,¡± said Day-Lewis, his thinning salt-and-pepper hair styled in a crew cut.
He eventually said yes because ¡°there¡¯s a need in you to express something of yourself through the life of another human being.¡±
Director Quentin Tarantino, who was a best-director nominee for his slavery-themed ¡°Django Unchained,¡± scored a win for best original screenplay, while cast member Christoph Waltz bagged the best-supporting-actor prize.
Tarantino was asked whether, having attacked Nazis in ¡°Inglourious Basterds¡± and slave owners in ¡°Django,¡± he planned another movie that would visit vengeance on history¡¯s bad guys.
Tarantino Trilogy
¡°I think there¡¯s something about this that begs a trilogy,¡± said Tarantino, his black tie loosened over a wrinkled white shirt. ¡°I don¡¯t know what the third one¡¯s going to be yet, but I wouldn¡¯t be surprised.¡±
The best-supporting actress Bafta went to Anne Hathaway -- also a Golden Globe winner in the same category -- for her part as the impoverished Fantine in ¡°Les Miserables.¡±
As ever at the Baftas, the weather was uncooperative. Non-stop rain left the red carpet soggy and paved with see-through umbrellas. One red-carpet TV reporter apologized for the climate as best-actress nominee Jennifer Lawrence headed in.
¡°It¡¯s okay, it¡¯s London!¡± cheered the now-blonde Lawrence, a dark coat bundled over her Dior gown. ¡°The summers are wonderful, but February...¡±
Lawrence¡¯s co-star in ¡°Silver Linings Playbook,¡± best-actor nominee Bradley Cooper, appeared in the mandatory tuxedo - - a change from his sloppy look on screen.
¡°To be able to act in sweat pants and sneakers and a trash bag the whole movie was fantastic: It was very comfortable,¡± said Cooper, who was greeted with shrieks of ¡°Bradley, Bradley¡± from drenched groupies.
Started in 1947 and honoring films produced worldwide and shown in U.K. cinemas, the Baftas are now held before the Oscars and get more attention as a gauge of the year¡¯s standout titles.

137,¡®Argo¡¯ Is Best Picture as Ang Lee¡¯s ¡®Pi¡¯ Wins Four Oscars,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Ben Affleck¡¯s ¡°Argo,¡± about the rescue of American hostages from Iran more than 30 years ago, won the Academy Award for best picture, beating eight other films including ¡°Lincoln.¡±
Ang Lee was voted best director for his fantasy ¡°Life of Pi¡± at the 85th Academy Awards last night in Hollywood. Daniel Day-Lewis got the Oscar for best actor, his third, for playing Abraham Lincoln, and Jennifer Lawrence captured best actress for her troubled character in ¡°Silver Linings Playbook.¡± First Lady Michelle Obama announced the best-picture winner.
The Oscar for ¡°Argo¡± marked Hollywood¡¯s highest praise for Affleck, who didn¡¯t get nominated for best director. Three historical pictures vied for best picture last night, including ¡°Argo,¡± ¡°Lincoln¡± and ¡°Zero Dark Thirty.¡± All faced questions about accuracy and the artistic license the creators took with the stories.
¡°It¡¯s tricky, you walk a fine line when you¡¯re doing an historical movie,¡± Affleck said backstage afterward. ¡°You try to honor the truth, the essence, the basic truth of the story you¡¯re telling. It¡¯s not an easy thing.¡±
Academy voters spread the honors around. ¡°Life of Pi¡± distributed by News Corp.¡¯s Fox, led with four awards, including best cinematography. The three for Time Warner Inc.¡¯s ¡°Argo¡± include best adapted screenplay. The musical ¡°Les Miserables,¡± from Comcast Corp.¡¯s Universal Pictures, also won three, including a supporting actress award for Anne Hathaway.
With his portrayal of the 16th U.S. president, Day-Lewis became the only actor to win Oscars for three leading roles. His past wins included ¡°There Will Be Blood¡± and ¡°My Left Foot.¡± Lincoln, with the most nominations at 12, won one other award, for production design.
¡®Silver Linings¡¯
Lawrence, collecting her first Oscar on her second nomination, made a plea to treat mental illness like other diseases. In ¡°Silver Linings Playbook¡± she and co-star Bradley Cooper come together as they cope with demons.
¡°You have asthma, you take asthma medicine. If you have diabetes, you take diabetes medicine,¡± Lawrence said. ¡°If you have to take medication for your mind, there¡¯s such a stigma behind it.¡±
Last night¡¯s show drew an audience of about 40.3 million viewers in the U.S., up 2.5 percent from 39.3 million a year earlier, ABC said today in a statement, citing Nielsen data.
It was the most-watched Oscars since March 2010, when 41.7 million tuned in and ¡°The Hurt Locker¡± won best picture.
Young Viewers
The audience of 18-to-49-year-olds, the group targeted by advertisers, increased 11 percent, the Walt Disney Co. network said. ¡°Family Guy¡± creator Seth MacFarlane, hired as host to attract younger viewers, helped boost ratings by 20 percent among younger adults ages 18 to 34, ABC said.
¡°Zero Dark Thirty,¡± about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden, was largely overlooked, sharing an Oscar in a tie vote for sound editing. The film, distributed by Sony Corp., was criticized in Washington and Hollywood for its portrayal of torture in the hunt for the al-Qaeda leader.
Collectively, the nine nominees for best picture have taken in $2.1 billion in theaters worldwide, with a little less than half from the U.S., according to Boxofficemojo.com, a movie research site. ¡°Lincoln,¡± distributed by Disney, is the domestic leader with $178.6 million in sales. ¡°Life of Pi¡± is the top grosser worldwide with $583.4 million in revenue.
The winners, chosen by the academy¡¯s 6,000 members, helped propel domestic ticket sales to a record $10.8 billion last year.
Host¡¯s Performance
¡°Studio accountants have never had to work harder to show that nothing made a profit,¡± MacFarlane joked during his opening monologue.
MacFarlane lived up to what was expected to be a polarizing first time as host. He introduced a tribute to the 2002 musical ¡°Chicago¡± by saying the awards show ¡°wasn¡¯t gay enough.¡± His teddy bear character from the film ¡°Ted¡± proclaimed he was Jewish so he could keep working in Hollywood, and he performed a musical number about women¡¯s breasts.
¡°I doubt there will ever have been a more divisive Oscars host than Seth MacFarlane,¡± said CNN talk-show host Piers Morgan on Twitter.com. ¡°I¡¯m loving him, others are hating him.¡±
Supporting Roles
In the supporting category Hathaway won for her portrayal of the ill-fated Fantine in the musical ¡°Les Miserables,¡± while Christoph Waltz won for playing the clever-tongued German bounty hunter in Quentin Tarantino¡¯s drama ¡°Django Unchained.¡± Tarantino won for best original screenplay.
¡°I love this movie because it¡¯s a fabulous, exciting piece of entertainment with a really deep message,¡± Waltz said backstage. ¡°I¡¯m happy that it¡¯s popular.¡± He also won the supporting award for his role as a Nazi in the 2009 Tarantino film ¡°Inglourious Basterds.¡±
Oscar statuettes promise even more revenue to studios that made and distributed the films. ¡°Slumdog Millionaire,¡± 2008¡¯s best film, took $43 million in U.S. ticket sales after winning best picture in 2009, adding to the $98.4 million generated before the victory, according to Hollywood.com Box-Office.
¡°The fact that we¡¯re not making movies for teenagers is kind of a cool thing,¡± Tarantino said in an interview backstage.
The show included a tribute to musicals with dance numbers featuring Charlize Theron with Channing Tatum, and Daniel Radcliffe, joining MacFarlane and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It also marked the 50th anniversary of James Bond pictures.

138,¡®Argo¡¯ Wins Golden Globe for Best Drama Over ¡®Lincoln¡¯,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Jan. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Time Warner Inc.¡¯s ¡°Argo¡± won Golden Globes for best drama and best director, beating ¡°Lincoln¡± and shaking up the competition for next month¡¯s Academy Awards.
¡°Les Miserables¡± won for best musical or comedy, best actor and best supporting actress at the the 70th annual awards yesterday in Beverly Hills, California. Steven Spielberg¡¯s ¡°Lincoln,¡± with seven nominations, received one award, for Daniel Day-Lewis¡¯s leading role in a drama.
The drama win and the award for director Ben Affleck re-establish ¡°Argo,¡± set amid the 1979-1981 Iranian hostage crisis, in the race for the best-picture Oscar, where Affleck was left off the list of directing finalists. The snub was seen as hurting the film¡¯s Oscar chances as ¡°Lincoln¡± racked up the most nominations at both awards shows.
¡°I¡¯m really grateful,¡± Affleck said backstage. ¡°We were nominated for seven Oscars -- I¡¯m thrilled. If you can¡¯t be happy with that, there¡¯s something wrong with you.¡±
The three awards for ¡°Les Miserables¡± and two each for ¡°Argo¡± and Quentin Tarantino¡¯s ¡°Django Unchained¡± bolstered those films¡¯ Oscar credentials as well. The ceremony takes place Feb. 24.
The Golden Globes, chosen by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, prime audiences to see movies they may have missed and provide an imperfect gauge of those most likely to win Academy Awards, the industry¡¯s highest honor. The voters agreed last year, when ¡°The Artist¡± won the best picture Oscar and the Globe for best musical or comedy. For 2008 movies, ¡°Slumdog Millionaire¡± won the Academy Award for best picture and the Golden Globes equivalent for a drama.
¡®Zero Overlap¡¯
¡°It¡¯s important to remember there is zero overlap in voters,¡± said Dave Karger, chief correspondent for Fandango.com. ¡°The Golden Globes go a little more for the star-driven films. They often go more for spectacle, larger scale films.¡±
The Globes give out two awards each in the categories of best picture, best actor and best actress -- one for dramas, and one for musicals or comedies.
Among musicals and comedies, Hugh Jackman won for his role in ¡°Les Miserables,¡± from Comcast Corp.¡¯s Universal Pictures, while Jennifer Lawrence received best actress honors for her role in Weinstein Co.¡¯s ¡°Silver Linings Playbook.¡± In drama, the winners were Day-Lewis and Jessica Chastain, for her role in Sony Corp.¡¯s ¡°Zero Dark Thirty.¡±
Anne Hathaway received the supporting-actress statuette for ¡°Les Miserables.¡± The singer Adele was honored for her song ¡°Skyfall,¡± written for the James Bond movie.
There was humor, surprise and controversy at this year¡¯s Globes, where the highest-profile films touched on slavery, hostage-taking, terrorism and torture.
Poehler, Fey
Actresses Amy Poehler and Tina Fey hosted the ceremony on Comcast¡¯s NBC. They replaced three-time host Ricky Gervais, whose caustic humor was sometimes aimed at members of the audience and the press association itself. His replacements didn¡¯t let up.
¡°As Ricky found out, when you go after the Hollywood foreign press they make you host the show two more times,¡± Poehler quipped during their opening routine.
Tony Mendez, the real-life ex-CIA agent whose story inspired ¡°Argo,¡± helped introduce the film, while former President Bill Clinton made an appearance to promote ¡°Lincoln,¡± lauding the Civil War president¡¯s efforts, some unsavory, to force political enemies to compromise.
¡°This brilliant film shows us how he did it and gives us hope that we can do it again,¡± Clinton said.
Jodie Foster received the Cecil B. DeMille award for outstanding career contributions.
Torture Controversy
¡°Zero Dark Thirty,¡± about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden, has generated controversy in Washington and in Hollywood by politicians, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, who object to the portrayal of harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding as helping to track down the al-Qaeda leader.
The film, which led the box office this weekend, its first in wide release, continues to stoke controversy. Actor Ed Asner condemned the movie for suggesting that torture was effective, the New York Times reported.
Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said in a statement that she stood by the filmmaker and any effort to punish artistic expression was ¡°abhorrent.¡±
Joked Poehler: ¡°When it comes to torture, I trust the lady who spent three years married to James Cameron,¡± a reference to director Kathryn Bigelow¡¯s ex-husband, the ¡°Avatar¡± director.
Django¡¯s Revenge
¡°Django Unchained¡± picked up best screenplay for director Tarantino and best supporting actor for Christoph Waltz, who won for a second time. The movie, released by Weinstein Co., treats the topic of U.S. slavery from the perspective of a blood soaked spaghetti Western -- a very different take than Spielberg¡¯s more traditionally paced ¡°Lincoln.¡±
Tarantino¡¯s movie has star Jamie Foxx exact revenge on slaveholders and reunite with his wife. The movie has been criticized for its violence and for its prolific use of a derogatory word for American blacks.
¡°I wanted a truly American story, told with the operatic stage and that canvas, and so it would have to be set in slave times in the antebellum South in Mississippi,¡± Tarantino said backstage. ¡°If I used that word more than it was actually used in the antebellum South, then I would understand the criticism, but nobody is saying that. So I don¡¯t believe I over-used the word.¡±
The three-hour awards telecast, which aired live in all time zones, was the most-watched Golden Globes ceremony in six years, NBC said today in an e-mailed statement. The show averaged 19.7 million viewers, 17 percent more than a year ago, NBC said, citing Nielsen data.

139,¡®Arrest¡¯ of Oracle¡¯s America¡¯s Cup Racing Yacht Halted by Judge,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
(Bloomberg) -- Defending America¡¯s Cup champion Oracle Racing Inc. avoided the impoundment of one of its sailboats in a dispute with a sailor who claims he was wrongfully thrown off the team.
The sailor had used maritime law to win a court order prohibiting the AC45-class racing catamaran from being moved while he sought pay for his termination. A federal magistrate judge in San Francisco vacated the order after a hearing Tuesday.
Joseph Spooner, a New Zealander, started working in 2014 on a contract basis for Larry Ellison¡¯s Oracle Team USA. After the 163-year-old sailing competition was moved to Bermuda, Spooner and the team got into a fight over salary and relocation expenses, resulting in his termination at the end of January, according to court records.
Spooner, who sought $750,000 in damages, was initially able to place a lien on the yacht after asserting that it was going to be shipped imminently to Bermuda, according to a court filing.
On further review, U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero concluded that because Spooner was hired to sail for Oracle Team USA without explicit reference to a specific vessel he had no right to a lien through the use of a so-called Admiralty arrest of the catamaran.
Oracle Team USA completed the biggest comeback in the history of the America¡¯s Cup in September 2013, beating Emirates Team New Zealand 9-8 after trailing 8-1.
Bermuda, about 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) east of the North Carolina coast, will host the event in 2017.
The case is Spooner v. Multi Hull Foiling AC45 Vessel ¡°4 Oracle Team USA,¡± 15-cv-00692, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco.)

140,¡®Arrogant¡¯ London Bankers Learn to Lobby Brussels as Power Moves,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 15 (Bloomberg) -- London, the financial capital of Europe, is coming to grips with a foreign concept: None of its three most important regulators speaks with a British accent.
For the island nation that opted out of the euro, the start of three European Union oversight agencies on New Year¡¯s Day has stirred anxiety about London¡¯s future as a money center and how to influence the EU, which is overhauling rules from bonuses and bank capital levels to naked short-selling, high-frequency trading and over-the-counter derivatives.
¡°The U.K. has to accept European regulation willingly in exchange for developing its position as Europe¡¯s financial center,¡± said Simon Gleeson, a financial regulatory lawyer at Clifford Chance LLP in London. ¡°The U.K. needs to be on the inside if it is to remain Europe¡¯s financial center.¡±
The EU regulators will set rules and guidelines for all of Europe, supervise their implementation and may intervene in nations during a crisis. National regulators won¡¯t have freedom to interpret the agencies¡¯ regulations. London bankers, who can appear ¡°arrogant and patronizing¡± to EU officials, according to a report by ex-Barclays Plc adviser Malcolm Levitt, must learn to negotiate with European partners as equals if their finance industry is to prosper, lawmakers and bankers said.
The shift has stirred concern among some Londoners long-wary of European integration that Brussels may be trying to weaken the city¡¯s role as the region¡¯s financial center.
¡®National Interest¡¯
¡°We have a national interest and a right to expect that our view is heard more than others when it comes to financial services,¡± said Andrew Hilton, director of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, a forum for bankers and regulators funded by institutions including the Bank of England. ¡°If the U.K. doesn¡¯t have the most influence in European regulation, it would be like saying the auto industry should be overseen by Latvians or the wine industry should be run by Estonians.¡±
No British bank employees are registered as lobbyists holding passes to enter the European Parliament, according to an official listing. By contrast, Italy¡¯s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, the world¡¯s oldest bank, has 13. Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG have four each, BNP Paribas SA and Morgan Stanley have two each, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have one each.
¡°Our rivals from other EU member states recognize the advantage of maintaining a continued presence in Brussels,¡± said Syed Kamall, a lawmaker in David Cameron¡¯s Conservative Party who represents London in the European Parliament.
Brian Mairs, a spokesman for the British Bankers¡¯ Association, which lobbies for U.K. banks, said the absence of passes doesn¡¯t indicate a lack of British influence. ¡°Passes might be convenient to lobbyists living in Brussels,¡± he said.
¡®Shift in Power¡¯
The new overseers of U.K. regulation include Italian Andrea Enria, chairman of the London-based European Banking Authority, which is implementing rules that limit upfront cash bonuses. Portugal¡¯s Gabriel Bernardino heads the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt. Dutchman Steven Maijoor chairs the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, which has the power to ban products deemed risky to financial stability.
¡°It¡¯s clearly a shift in power,¡± Kamall said. ¡°The most effective way for me to stand up for the City when I¡¯m in Brussels is not to wave a Union Jack and say, ¡®We want this.¡¯¡±
The U.K.¡¯s Financial Services Authority, Europe¡¯s biggest financial regulator, is being broken up by Britain¡¯s government. The limits of the FSA¡¯s ability to shape rules and supervise firms were exposed during the crisis, former U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling said in an interview.
¡®Push Back¡¯
¡°We did push back against EU financial regulation until 2007,¡± said Darling, whose government approved the creation of the new EU regulators in 2009. ¡°What changed was that during the banking crisis it became obvious that there were a lot of issues in relation to regulation that needed to be resolved at a cross-border level.¡± Darling is now an opposition lawmaker.
Critics say the EU regulators will push business away from U.K. financial districts such as the City of London and Canary Wharf, which paid 53.4 billion pounds ($85 billion) in tax in the year through March 2010, or 11 percent of the total, according to accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. London is home to about 240 overseas banks, including the European bases for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
¡®Very Foolish¡¯
Britain is also home to about 80 percent of Europe¡¯s hedge funds and about 60 percent of its private equity firms. The U.K. accounts for about 37 percent of all global foreign exchange trading and 46 percent of all trading of over-the-counter interest rate derivatives, according to lobby group TheCityUK. More than 1 million people work in the financial industry in the U.K., according to the City of London Corporation.
¡°It¡¯s very foolish to have given these powers away to the EU,¡± said Stuart Wheeler, founder of London-based spread-betting company IG Group Holdings Plc and treasurer of the U.K. Independence Party, which wants Britain to leave the EU and got the second-most votes in the U.K. in the European Parliament election in 2009. ¡°The burden of regulation that the EU is imposing on financial companies is far too great.¡±
British financial representatives can make ¡°chauvinistic and counterproductive¡± arguments, said Malcolm Levitt, a former U.K. Treasury official. He wrote a December report entitled ¡°Getting Brussels Right¡± based on 68 interviews in London and Brussels. U.K. firms can be too slow to get involved with EU policymaking, he said. They should avoid ¡°self-serving pleading¡± and show how they benefit the EU, he said.
¡®Learning to Engage¡¯
The U.K. won¡¯t be without influence on the new EU watchdogs: FSA Chief Executive Officer Hector Sants, 55, is on the board of the new insurance agency. FSA banking director Thomas Huertas is alternate chairman of the new EU banking authority, filling in for Enria when he¡¯s unavailable; Alexander Justham, the FSA¡¯s director of markets, is on the board of the securities and markets regulator. London¡¯s lobbyists say lenders will also adapt the way they make their arguments to the new regulators.
¡°The City is learning to engage more proactively¡± with the EU, said Angela Knight, CEO of the British Bankers¡¯ Association, which represents 200 lenders including HSBC Holdings Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc. ¡°We need a more peer-to-peer approach.¡±
The BBA¡¯s priorities in Brussels include monitoring laws to incorporate the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision¡¯s new rules and to manage bank failures, Knight said. The BBA is resisting regulators¡¯ plans to force a leverage ratio on banks as well as any attempts by other EU states to dilute the Basel Committee¡¯s definition of core Tier 1 capital, a measure of lenders¡¯ financial strength, by widening the definition to include instruments beyond common equity and retained earnings.
¡®Unintended Consequences¡¯
The elected European Parliament is reviewing laws restricting naked short-selling and trading in over-the-counter derivatives. The European Commission, the EU¡¯s executive body, is readying an overhaul of market rules to cover dark pools and high-frequency trading.
Both moves are being challenged in London. More disclosure of short positions on securities such as sovereign debt could have ¡°serious unintended consequences¡± and may force trading of securities to leave the EU, according to Andrew Baker, chief executive of the London-based Alternative Investment Manager Association, which lobbies for hedge funds. Naked short sellers bet against a security, such as a government bond, without first borrowing it.
The case for more oversight of dark pools, trading platforms that allow investors to buy and sell securities away from regulated exchanges so they don¡¯t have to disclose positions, is ¡°often exaggerated,¡± according to U.K. Treasury minister Mark Hoban.
¡®Manage Its Grief¡¯
Bank officials such as Sacha Polverini, Barclays¡¯s director of European public policy, said they see the benefits of the new European regulators. They will create ¡°increased consistency in the way prudential rules are implemented,¡± he said.
¡°As Germany has to manage its grief about the demise of German monetary authority and accept the European Central Bank, I think exactly the same is true of the U.K. with financial regulation,¡± said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow who works on regulation at Bruegel, a Brussels-based research group. ¡°The City has nothing to gain from fighting yesterday¡¯s fight.¡±

142,`Astrology' Blamed for Loss of Louisiana Coast to Rising Seas,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
By Eric Roston
Few things are as uniquely unsustainable as southern Louisiana. Astrology last month briefly joined the list of forces blamed for the Gulf of Mexico swallowing the equivalent of a football field of Louisiana land every hour -- about 1,900 square miles since the 1930s.
The Louisiana Applied Coastal & Environmental Sciences Division (LACES) issued a study at the end of January recommending that policymakers plan for an estimated one-meter rise in sea level this century. The report's summary for coastal managers curiously stated that ""Sea-level rise is caused by a variety of dynamic interactions, and is influenced by atmospheric, geologic, oceanic, and astrological changes, whether natural or anthropogenic.""
It's the kind of disclaimer often added by politicians and bureaucrats to gird against conservative backlash when discussing matters related to climate change. Â The full technical report describes the astronomical contribution of 18.6 year lunar cycles on coastal processes, but no suggestion of horoscopes. It seems unlikely that the authors of the technical report -- each with a decade or more of advanced science education and environmental management experience -- would bobble ""astrological"" and ""astronomical.""
For guidance on whom to talk to about natural and manmade astrology, I emailed Kyle Graham, deputy director of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority implementation office (and a reliable wit). Graham recommended my next step: ""During business hours the appropriate staff to speak with mans our Tarot table. It would have to be an early morning or evening interview--during a waxing or waning gibbous, of course.""
The issue here is more serious than the amusing typographical error, which has since been corrected. Land loss is decimating one of the world's great river deltas, a rich source for the U.S. economy and home to culture-rich New Orleans. So I put the question slightly differently to Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who happened to walk into the restaurant I was eating at Friday night. He was in Washington for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), being held down the street from the New Heights restaurant in the Woodley Park neighborhood.
Jindal arrived with his wife and a security detail, and fell into conversation with Hogan Gidley, Rick Santorum's campaign communications director, who was dining with John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, the authors of the 2010 political blockbuster Game Change. Jindal deferred to his coastal defense chief when I asked about the causes of land loss.Â  Wearing a tux and holding a garment bag, he instead focused on the need for federal attention to the state's coastline. His sentiment could apply to any of a number of stalled issues in the nation's capital: Many members of Congress say they support action against Louisiana's wetland loss, but little has occurred toward a comprehensive solution, he said. ""We need people to have continued interest.""
The federal government has played a key role in Louisiana coastal land loss. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers corseted the Mississippi River with levees in the 1930s, after the Great Flood of 1927. With levees pushing sediment flow past the river¡¯s mouth, Louisiana can't fortify itself against the sea by creating new land. Flooding is destructive to farms and cities but necessary for healthy river deltas. The state projects another 1,800 square miles of land to disappear in the next 50 years.

143,¡®Cloud Atlas¡¯ Is Weird Mess; Surfers; ¡®Other Son¡¯: Movies,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Three giddy hours after a battle-scarred, cosmetically aged Tom Hanks starts talking, the $100 million folly called ¡°Cloud Atlas¡± gets to its point.
¡°You want de true-true?¡± asks a futuristic emissary played by Halle Berry in the weird, pseudo-Cajun patois of a radiated 24th-century Hawaii.
Rough translation: ¡°You can¡¯t handle the truth.¡±
Amusing and silly, ambitious and trite -- ¡°Cloud Atlas,¡± written and directed by siblings Lana and Andy Wachowski (¡°The Matrix¡± trilogy) and Tom Tykwer (¡°Run Lola Run¡±), sells more New Age hokum than a college-town crystal store.
Sample true-trues: Death is a door, love is immortal and each soul fine-tunes itself through one overblown reincarnation after another.
Based on the bestselling 2004 novel by David Mitchell, ¡°Cloud Atlas¡± juggles six tales spanning as many centuries, landscapes and literary genres.
A small army of brand-name actors populates every era, often smearing ethnic, age and gender lines with gobs of unconvincing make-up.
So we get Susan Sarandon with tribal tattoos here and a cupcake-sized nose there, Hugh Grant covered in war paint or covered in a geezer¡¯s slack skin.
Corporate Conspiracy
Chronologically (and stripped to the bones):
In 1849, a seafaring attorney (Jim Sturgess) forms an unlikely bond with a runaway slave (David Gyasi); in 1936 Scotland, an ambitious young musician (Ben Whishaw) gloms onto an aging, malevolent composer (Jim Broadbent); and in 1973, a San Francisco journalist (Berry) investigates a far-reaching corporate conspiracy.
Jumping forward: In 2012, a British publisher (Broadbent) escapes creditors by hiding out in a snake-pit nursing home; in the totalitarian ¡°Neo Seoul¡± of 2144, a meek, genetically engineered servant (Doona Bae) becomes a freedom fighter; and in the post-apocalypse 24th century, a village goatherd (Hanks) aids an emissary (Berry) from an advanced society.
¡°Cloud Atlas¡± unfolds with unexpected clarity, its connective threads conveniently explicit -- a 1936 diary turns up in 1973, say, or a comet-shaped birthmark tracks one soul through its earthly lifetimes.
Certainly, some lifetimes are better than others.
The three Tykwer-directed pastiches have surer footing, riffing on ¡°Three Days of the Condor¡± paranoia in the 1973 plot and lampooning British music-hall comedy in the nursing-home farce (with Hugo Weaving done up in Nurse Ratched drag).
Hanks Villainy
The Wachowski segments, while more daring, are spottier. The sci-fi action of 2144 has thrills and a ¡°Blade Runner¡± beauty, but overstays itself, while the salt-aired shipboard adventure is undone by Hanks¡¯s outsized, bucktoothed villainy.
The film¡¯s sole unequivocal failure arrives with the 24th century.
Traipsing through a CGI wilderness, Hanks and Berry take on horseback savages, a green-skinned ghoul in a Mardi Gras top hat, ludicrous syntax and bookshelf spirituality.
And dat, as dey say, is de true-true.
¡°Cloud Atlas,¡± from Warner Bros. Pictures, is playing across the U.S. Rating: **1/2 (Evans)
¡®Chasing Mavericks¡¯
The mountainous waves dwarf the actors, literally and figuratively, in ¡°Chasing Mavericks.¡±
They¡¯re the real star of the movie, directed by Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted and photographed, heroically, by Bill Pope. It tells the story of the 15-year-old surfing phenomenon Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston), who trained in the 1990s with the champion Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler) to ride a legendary wave.
One of the many things movies have in common with opera is their ability to touch you even when the script is indifferent. The beauty and athleticism of the surfers, their graceful pivots across the sparkling water, do more to give these characters soul than the script does.
It manufactures all kinds of life problems for the fatherless boy to face down and hammers at his teacher¡¯s father-figure role. But the majesty of the surfing sequences makes the rather puny drama surprisingly affecting.
It helps that the actors, especially the women -- Frosty¡¯s wife (Abigail Spencer), Jay¡¯s mother (Elisabeth Shue) and his girlfriend (Leven Rambin) -- underplay their maudlin scenes.
But the scenes that matter are the ones in the water. The movie is a pleasure to look at from the beginning. By the end, it¡¯s close to euphoric.
¡°Chasing Mavericks,¡± from 20th Century Fox, is playing across the U.S. Rating: **** (Seligman)
¡®The Other Son¡¯
¡°The Other Son¡± sets up the predicament at once: The sons of an Israeli and a Palestinian couple have been switched at birth. Now, on the eve of their turning 18, the boys and their families learn the truth.
What the movie¡¯s director, Lorraine Levy, does next is remarkable: very little. Instead of burying the intensity of the situation under plot complications, she simply watches the reactions. And that¡¯s enough.
This French-made film is one of those rare pictures that manages to get at what¡¯s going on inside rather than outside its characters. Levy uses the Israel-Palestine conflict as a way of underlining the boys¡¯ self-questioning: What does it really mean to be a Jew? An Arab?
She handles the politics of the conflict delicately, without playing them down. The Israeli father is an army colonel, the Palestinian an engineer reduced to fixing cars because he isn¡¯t allowed to work outside his village.
Mothers¡¯ Fear
Their first reaction is anger, compounded by frustration at the lack of a good target for it. The mothers¡¯ faces betray something more complex: a mixture of fear (though of what it¡¯s hard to say) and a dawning love for the sons they never knew they had.
The movie is an actor¡¯s feast. The questions it raises about family and identity are too big to have answers, and it doesn¡¯t try to provide any.
The splendid music is by Dhafer Youssef.
¡°The Other Son,¡± from Cohen Media Group, is playing in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami, St. Louis, Seattle, Detroit and Washington. Rating: **** (Seligman)

144,¡®Avalanche¡¯ of Sales Drives Rates to 16-Month High: Muni Credit,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Dec. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Yields on top-rated tax-exempt securities due in 30 years climbed twice as fast as those on U.S. Treasuries, reaching the highest level in almost 16 months.
The prospect that tax-free municipal issuance will surge if the Build America Bonds program isn¡¯t renewed after Dec. 31 drove 30-year tax-exempt rates up 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 4.84 percent, the highest since Aug. 17, 2009, according to a Bloomberg Valuation index.
Bondholders sought buyers for $1.4 billion in debt yesterday, the most since June 15, 2006, according to a Bloomberg bids-wanted index.
¡°Nobody¡¯s bidding,¡± Tony Shields, a principal in the public-finance department at Williams Capital Group LP in New York, said in an e-mail. There¡¯s ¡°an avalanche of bid-wanteds, and there is just not enough liquidity to accommodate this much sell-side pressure.¡±
Treasury prices plunged yesterday, pushing the 30-year bond yield to a seven-month high, as Federal Reserve policy makers said the U.S. recovery is continuing and maintained a $600 billion program of debt purchases. The 30-year bond yield increased 12 basis points to 4.53 percent yesterday before prices rallied today, pushing the yield down to 4.5 percent in early New York trading, according to BGCantor Market Data.
Municipal-bond yields jumped at almost every maturity, except rates on 1- and 2-year debt, which fell 4 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively, BVAL benchmark indexes show. Tax-exempts coming due in 25 years rose for a sixth straight day, climbing 14 basis points to 4.72 percent yesterday, the highest since Aug. 12, 2009.
New York
Amid the rising yields, New York City cut today¡¯s tax-exempt offering by two-thirds to $100 million citing ¡°volatile market conditions,¡± the Office of Management and Budget said in a press release yesterday.
Long-term rates may increase more than 50 basis points next year if the Build America program isn¡¯t renewed, according to a research note by analysts led by John Hallacy, manager of municipal research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.
The subsidy was left out of an agreement President Barack Obama struck with Republicans, some of whom have been critical of the program. While in the minority, the party has enough power to stall the legislation. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, who previously led an unsuccessful bid to extend the program, offered an amendment this week to include it in the tax bill.
Build Americas
Build Americas, which are commonly issued for longer durations to take advantage of the 35 percent federal subsidy on interest costs, have accounted for about 23 percent of municipal issuance since the program began in April 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost $181 billion of the securities have been sold.
The market has ¡°reacted to the fact that there¡¯s more longer-dated paper coming¡± next year, said John Flahive, a Boston-based director of fixed income for BNY Mellon Wealth Management who oversees about $20 billion in municipal bonds.
As tax-exempt rates continue rising, investors will eventually be drawn back to the market, Flahive said. Yields climbing above 5 percent for 30-year munis is often the tipping point, he said.
¡°Look at the yields; there¡¯s not a lot of demand right now,¡± he said. ¡°Eventually the yield curve is so steep, you¡¯re getting 5 percent yields. Empirically that¡¯s a pretty attractive level.¡±
Reduced Demand
The reduced demand, coupled with mutual-fund redemptions and rising Treasury yields has helped create a ¡°perfect storm¡± for the tax-exempt selloff, Shields said.
Municipal-bond mutual funds had net outflows of $7.6 billion last month, after 22 consecutive months of inflows, according to data from Morningstar Inc. Investors had added more than $105 billion from January 2009 through October 2010.
Average yields on Build Americas jumped 15 basis points to 6.5 percent yesterday, the highest since Dec. 28, 2009, according to a Wells Fargo index.

145,¡®Avatar¡¯ 3-D Projector Maker RealD Files for IPO,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 9 (Bloomberg) -- RealD Inc., a maker of 3-D film projectors and glasses used to show the movie ¡°Avatar,¡± filed to raise as much as $200 million in an initial public offering.
RealD, based in Beverly Hills, California, didn¡¯t provide a price or number of shares in the filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Theaters worldwide are stepping up the installation of 3-D equipment following the success of ¡°Avatar,¡± which has grossed more than $2.7 billion globally, according to Box Office Mojo. RealD¡¯s equipment was deployed on 5,321 theater screens in 51 countries, more than all competitors combined, the company said in the filing.
¡°The recent success of major 3-D motion pictures, including ¡®¡®Avatar¡¯¡¯ and ¡®¡®Alice in Wonderland,¡¯¡¯ is leading to the creation and distribution of new 3-D content for the consumer electronics market,¡± the company said in the filing.
Last weekend¡¯s top-selling movie in U.S. cinema, ¡°Clash of the Titans,¡± also was offered in 3-D format.
RealD plans to use the proceeds from the IPO to repay debt, which totaled $29.2 million as of Dec. 25, and for general corporate purposes.
RealD posted a net loss of $28.9 million on revenue of $96 million in the nine months ended Dec. 25, according to the filing.
The company plans to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RLD, according to the filing.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. of New York and Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray Cos. were hired to lead RealD¡¯s initial sale.

Nov. 3 (Bloomberg) -- RealD Inc., the maker of 3-D movie projectors that first sold stock to the public in July, rose 22 percent in New York after reporting second-quarter results that exceeded analysts¡¯ estimates.
RealD jumped $4.75 to $26.96 at 4:03 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after reaching a record $27.76. The Beverly Hills, California-based company, which also distributes the glasses viewers use to watch three-dimensional movies, sold 12.5 million shares at $16 each on July 15.
Sales in the quarter ended Sept. 24 rose 69 percent to $65.3 million, the company said yesterday in a statement. That exceeded the $49 million average estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The net loss narrowed to $5.1 million, or 12 cents a share, from $5.4 million, or 22 cents, and was smaller than the 22-cent loss predicted by analysts.
The number of RealD screens almost tripled to 9,300 by the end of the quarter, the company said in the statement. They included 5,600 in the U.S.
This quarter, RealD expects to add 1,800 to 2,200 screens, Andrew Skarupa, chief financial officer, said yesterday on a conference call. Capital spending on RealD Cinema Systems for the full year will be $70 million to $75 million, he said.

147,"RealD, Qlik Rise as Demand for Technology IPOs Climbs","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
July 16 (Bloomberg) -- RealD Inc., the maker of 3-D movie projectors used to show James Cameron¡¯s ¡°Avatar,¡± and Qlik Technologies Inc. surged more than 20 percent after pricing initial public offerings above their forecast range as demand for technology IPOs picked up.
RealD climbed 22 percent to $19.51 in New York Stock Exchange trading today. The company raised $200 million yesterday, 24 percent more than sought, a statement and a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed. Qlik, which makes software for BP Plc and Kraft Foods Inc., increased 28 percent to $12.80 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after pricing its IPO at $10 a share, more than its range of $8.50 to $9.50.
The deals came after interactive whiteboard maker Smart Technologies Inc. completed the second-largest U.S. initial sale of 2010 and pushed the amount raised by IPOs in America above $1 billion this week. Filings for initial offerings climbed to the highest since 2007 last quarter even as deals worldwide were canceled at the fastest rate since the collapse of New York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
¡°There is a perception that technology companies are going to be able to expand globally,¡± said Michael Yoshikami, who oversees about $1 billion as chief investment strategist at YCMNet Advisors in Walnut Creek, California. ¡°There are going to be selective assets if their offerings are compelling that are going to price above the market.¡±
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray Cos. led RealD¡¯s offering.
¡®Avatar¡¯ Sales
RealD, which collects fees from theaters that use its projectors, priced 12.5 million shares at $16 each after offering 10.75 million for $13 to $15, Bloomberg data show. The Beverly Hills, California-based company has lost money in every year since 2005, when its equipment was first used to show 3-D movies, according to its SEC filing.
¡°Avatar,¡± the futuristic adventure movie that makes use of RealD¡¯s 3-D projectors and glasses, has taken a record $2.73 billion of worldwide box-office receipts since its December release, according to Box Office Mojo, a researcher based in Sherman Oaks, California.
The company, which plans to expand in 3-D televisions, computers and video games, will use the money to pay debt and for possible takeovers, the filing showed.
At the midpoint price of $14, RealD had an enterprise value, or the sum of its stock and debt minus cash, of 22 times estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a report from London-based researcher Independent International Investment Research Plc showed.
Relative Value
IMAX Corp., the Mississauga, Ontario-based operator of big-screen movie theaters, and Dolby Laboratories Inc. of San Francisco, which RealD cites as its main competitors, are valued at 7.5 times and 12 times enterprise value to estimated Ebitda, respectively, according to the report.
Shamrock Capital Advisors, the private equity firm based in Burbank, California, was selling 1.4 million shares in RealD¡¯s IPO, the filing showed. The fund is affiliated with Shamrock Holdings of California Inc., which was founded by Roy Disney in 1978, according to the Shamrock Web site.
Qlik raised $112 million in its IPO. The Radnor, Pennsylvania-based company had sought $106.4 million. The sale was managed by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan of New York. The stock started trading today under the ticker QLIK.
Smart Technologies of Calgary, which raised $660 million after seeking as much as $635 million, completed the biggest initial offering in the U.S. since Houston-based Oasis Petroleum Inc. sold $676 million of shares in June.
The offering was also the biggest by a Canadian technology company in at least a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

148,3-D Suppliers Work Flat Out for China After ¡®Avatar¡¯,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 1 (Bloomberg) -- Makers of digital movie equipment are forecasting a surge in sales as Chinese and European cinemas upgrade to tap the popularity of 3-D movies such as ¡°Avatar.¡±
Sales at Christie Digital Systems USA, the world¡¯s largest maker of digital projectors, may double to $400 million this year if it can meet demand, said Jack Kline, president of the Cypress, California-based company, a unit of Japan¡¯s Ushio Inc. Kortrijk, Belgium-based Barco NV, the second largest, estimates revenue will climb 50 percent to $200 million.
The upgrades in Asia and Europe are part of a worldwide trend in theater spending. The three largest U.S. chains are outfitting 14,000 screens for digital projection after raising $660 million. Cinemas charge more for 3-D movies and will benefit from the 19 films scheduled for release this year, up from 14 in 2009, according to researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office. Digital systems also cut costs by eliminating film reels and projectionists.
¡°We didn¡¯t expect China to expand so fast,¡± said Andrew Robinson, managing director at Harkness Screens International Ltd., the largest maker of screens for digital cinemas. Closely held Harkness, based in Dublin, sold 500 screens in China last year, Robinson said.
Harkness is running its U.S. factory around the clock, seven days a week, Robinson said in an interview. A second plant in France is running 18 hours a day, he said. The wait for delivery is 10 weeks, up from the usual four, he said.
Like in the U.S., demand for 3-D theaters in China is increasing following the success of James Cameron¡¯s ¡°Avatar,¡± the highest-grossing movie of all time, said Weng Li, a spokesman for China Film Group, the state-run company that controls most cinemas and film distribution in that nation.
¡®Avatar¡¯ Effect
There are about 2,000 digital screens in China, including 800 that are equipped to show movies in 3-D, Li said in an interview. Even small cities in China are installing 3-D equipment, he said.
¡°Avatar¡± has generated $193.6 million in ticket sales in China since its release, the film¡¯s second-highest grossing nation behind the U.S., according to News Corp.¡¯s Twentieth Century Fox.
China Film Group is seeking bids to add 500 digital projectors over the next four to six months, said John Wilmers, chief executive officer of Ballantyne Strong Inc., an Omaha, Nebraska-based seller of digital cinema equipment and services.
Time Antaeus Media Group, based in China, plans to add 500 to 700, Christie¡¯s Kline said.
Ushio was little changed at 1,586 yen yesterday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Barco NV rose 9 cents to 33.38 euros on Euronext Brussels. Ballantyne Strong advanced 10 cents to $5.40 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
¡®Jackass¡¯
Rules in China may limit the benefits of 3-D popularity. Some 3-D movies may never be seen in the country because the government allows about 20 foreign films to be shown each year, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.
Consumers may also lose enthusiasm for 3-D as the format becomes more common, said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities in Denver.
¡°Do you really need to see ¡®Jackass¡¯ in 3-D,¡± Harrigan said in an interview. ¡°It wouldn¡¯t surprise me if we had a little bit of a lull at some point.¡±
Cinema chains worldwide will spend about $1 billion over the next three to four years upgrading screens for digital projection, according to George Hawkey, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York.
3-D Crunch
DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc.¡¯s ¡°How to Train Your Dragon¡± opened as the top film at U.S. and Canadian theaters last weekend, posting $43.3 million in ticket sales. The movie played in 3-D at more than half of the 4,055 theaters, according to Box Office Mojo, a Sherman Oaks, California-based researcher. It is competing for 3-D screens with ¡°Alice in Wonderland¡± and ¡°Clash of the Titans,¡± which Time Warner Inc. is releasing this weekend.
¡°There is a crunch, no doubt,¡± Harkness Screens International¡¯s Robinson said.
In the U.S., theaters will add about 2,500 3-D screens this year to some 3,500 already in place, said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theatre Owners. The conversion in the U.S. is being financed through a fee studios pay to theaters for movies that are shown on digital screens. Studios will save money as they phase out 35mm prints of movies, which cost about $1,200 each to produce.
Cinema operators benefit because digitally equipped theaters don¡¯t need employees to change reels, said David Passman, chief executive officer of Carmike Cinemas Inc., the fourth-largest U.S. chain. All of the projectors in a multiplex can be controlled by a single employee at a computer, Passman said.
Digital Financing
Carmike Cinemas, based in Columbus, Georgia, has 2,288 screens, almost all of them digital, with 500 equipped for 3-D films, Passman said.
Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, a collaboration of Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Cinemark Holdings Inc., last month completed financing to convert 14,000 screens to digital projection.
Cinedigm Digital Cinema Corp., a provider of digital services and equipment, has raised $100 million to cover digital conversions for smaller chains, the company said in October.

149,¡®Avatar¡¯ Digital Aliens Spell Doom for Independent Theaters,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 18 (Bloomberg) -- The Prince Charles, a London movie theater that¡¯s more likely to screen ¡°The Rocky Horror Picture Show¡± than a James Cameron blockbuster, is struggling to pay for Hollywood demands to go digital.
The two-screen, independent cinema doesn¡¯t have the funds of the neighboring Odeon theater at Leicester Square, where Hollywood films premiere and stars walk the red carpet. It must still pay the same 60,000 pounds ($86,500) to convert each of its screens to digital, as studios replace celluloid.
¡°We are financially stretched,¡± said its manager, Gregory Lynn. ¡°So many indie cinemas like us cannot afford to go digital, but we don¡¯t really have a choice.¡±
The movie house is among thousands of small cinemas -- mostly in Europe -- in danger of going bust unless they make the switch. The conversion costs may leave some small towns with no theaters, and fewer venues to screen movies may result in the shrinking of the European film industry, already concerned about the cultural dominance of Hollywood.
¡°European films are mostly watched in Europe and generally only seen in their own country,¡± said Jean Cazes, a producer of movies including the Oscar-winning ¡°Leaving Las Vegas¡± and vice president of the European Producers¡¯ Club.
With Hollywood studios counting on savings of $1 billion a year by ditching 35-millimeter prints for digital, the days of ¡°Cinema Paradiso¡± may be history in as little as three years, replaced by 3-D blockbusters ¡°Avatar,¡± ¡°Alice in Wonderland¡± and ¡°Clash of the Titans.¡±
Cannes Spotlight
The issue took spotlight at the Cannes Film Festival, currently under way, in a Council of Europe-sponsored seminar. In Europe, where the largest chains represent only 10 percent of the continent¡¯s 30,000 screens, more cinemas could fold. North America¡¯s largest cinema chains account for 60 percent of about 39,000 screens.
¡°A cinema will absolutely go out of business if they don¡¯t upgrade,¡± said John Fithian, head of the North American Theater Owners. ¡°Smaller exhibitors that cannot afford digital technology will go out of business.¡±
Theater owners are switching to higher-quality digital following the success of 3-D movies, which command higher ticket prices. ¡°Avatar¡± is the world¡¯s top-grossing film, having taken in $2.72 billion in worldwide box-office receipts since its Dec. 18 release.
A digital projector and server also allow a cinema to show a variety of content including live sporting events and concerts, said David Hancock, head of the cinema market at researcher Screen Digest, based in London.
¡®If, Not When¡¯
For Hollywood studios like Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures, digital significantly cuts the price of manufacturing and distributing 35-mm film. They can deliver video files electronically.
Studios plan to release 19 3-D films this year, according to Hollywood.com. Box office receipts reached records worldwide last year with total sales in Europe of $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion in the U.S., according to Hancock.
¡°Digital is not an ¡®if¡¯ thing, it¡¯s a ¡®when¡¯,¡± he said. ¡°Within four years major markets like the U.S., U.K. and France will be fully digital.¡±
France leads the way in Europe for digital screens, with 959 converted so far out of 5,440, according to Screen Digest. Europe has 4,580 digital screens out of 37,600, while the U.S. has 7,418 out of 39,233.
Government Help
Governments in Europe are stepping in to help small, beleaguered movie theaters. The European Union plans to pay as much as 50 percent of the cost of digital equipment for cinemas that show a majority of European films.
The U.K. Cinema Exhibitors¡¯ Association formed the U.K. Digital Funding Partnership this year to help smaller cinemas secure financing for the switchover and negotiate fees studios pay to theaters for movies shown on digital screens.
The partnership aims to have 500 U.K. screens signed up by the end of the summer and is in loan talks with financial institutions, said Phil Clapp, the association¡¯s head.
The U.S.¡¯s National Association of Theater Owners did the same several years ago when it worked with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and General Electric Co. to raise funds to convert screens, Fithian said.
¡°The real danger here is in the small towns, where we could see cinemas disappear,¡± Fithian said. ¡°I think where we are now the model is relatively fair. Where it started was unfair and the studios wanted it right away. George Lucas and his team described us as dinosaurs holding back the industry.¡±
Survival
JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised almost $700 million to equip the three largest U.S. cinema chains, Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Cinemark Holdings Inc. this year. Europe¡¯s largest cinema chain, Berlin-based Odeon Film AG, raised 37 million pounds in private equity in direct negotiations with studios to help foot conversion costs, and is funding the switchover itself.
Cineworld Group Plc in London has converted about a third of its screens, about 232, to digital, with its own funds, said Chief Executive Officer Steve Wiener.
¡°In the cinema industry, whenever there¡¯s been a major technological change, the good small exhibitors will find resources and survive,¡± he said. ¡°The smaller ones won¡¯t.¡±
At the Coronet Cinema in London¡¯s Notting Hill, projectionist Chris Bird isn¡¯t convinced his two-screen picture house needs to go digital.
¡°3-D comes and goes and who know how long it will hang around now,¡± the 40-year-old said. ¡°Just like Quentin Tarantino said he likes working with film, I think you¡¯ll have some filmmakers that will resist working with digital.¡±
¡®Avatar¡¯ Effect
Arts Alliance Media Ltd., a London-based company that supplies software and services for digital-film projection, has done deals with exhibitors in countries including the U.K., France and Denmark. In March, it secured 50 million euros ($63.3 million) from Bain Capital LLC¡¯s credit affiliate Sankaty Advisors to help fund the rollout of equipment.
¡°It¡¯s obviously harder for small cinemas who need to figure out what to do with digital,¡± said Howard Kiedaisch, chief of Arts Alliance Media. ¡°It¡¯s like going from using a typewriter to a computer.¡±
Kiedaisch said the turning point for digital gaining momentum was the release of ¡°Avatar.¡±
¡°Now, if you order digital equipment it won¡¯t arrive until November or December,¡± he said. ¡°Six months ago it would come the next week.¡±
At London¡¯s Prince Charles, manager Lynn is hoping his cinema¡¯s recent membership in the U.K. Digital Fund will help it pay for the conversion of its second screen to digital.
¡°We¡¯ve had no encouragement from any film company to make the changes so we¡¯re lucky to have done it by ourselves. We don¡¯t have luxury like the big chains.¡±

April 12 (Bloomberg) -- Director James Cameron said Brazil¡¯s plan to build a hydroelectric dam in the Amazon rainforest will harm the environment.
Cameron spoke to dam opponents in Brasilia today. He is in Brazil this week to protest against the construction of the Belo Monte dam on the Xingu River, set to be the world¡¯s third biggest when it¡¯s completed.

151,¡¯Avatar¡¯ Director Cameron Urges Studios to Shoot More in 3-D,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 15 (Bloomberg) -- James Cameron, the Oscar-award winning director of blockbuster movies such as ¡°Avatar¡± and ¡°Titanic,¡± said having separate production teams for content filmed in 2-D and then converted into 3-D isn¡¯t efficient.
Speaking at the Abu Dhabi Media Summit, Cameron urged studios to film in the more expensive 3-D format. Overall box office revenue has risen because of the higher price of tickets for 3-D films, even as fewer tickets have been sold, he said.
In an on-stage interview with James Murdoch, the head of New Corp.¡¯s European and Asian operations, Cameron said 3-D adds to the value of entertainment, including sporting events and drama. Cameron said he opts to make big-screen films such as 3-D flicks that must be watched in a movie theater.
¡°I think it will be difficult in a few year¡¯s time for photographers and filmmakers to say that 3-D is too tricky to figure out,¡± and then the process will become much more mainstream, Cameron said.
Murdoch and Cameron opened the second annual Abu Dhabi Media Summit, which features speakers including Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg and Google Inc. Chief Business Officer Nikesh Arora.
Avatar is the world¡¯s top-grossing film, having taken about $2.8 billion since its December 2009 release, according to Box Office Mojo, a website for the movie industry.

152,¡®Avatar¡¯ Filming Site Sold as Part of Los Angeles Project Deal,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 21 (Bloomberg) -- The hangar where Howard Hughes built his Spruce Goose airplane and the ¡°Avatar¡± movie was shot is part of a complex in Los Angeles that¡¯s being sold in three transactions.
A partnership led by closely held Mar Ventures Inc., a Torrance, California-based real estate developer, has agreed to buy most of the 56-acre (23-hectare) property¡¯s undeveloped land, Mike Dorris, senior project manager for the site¡¯s receiver, Trigild Inc., said yesterday.
Ratkovich Co., a Los Angeles-based developer, will buy historic buildings developed by Hughes at the site, while the Spruce Goose hangar and the rest of the undeveloped land will be sold to a film-production company that Dorris declined to name.
¡°We are finalizing the purchase and sales agreements,¡± Dorris said. The transactions, which need court approval, will probably be completed in two to three months, he said.
The property was encumbered by a $155 million loan on which Walton Street Capital LLC and Tishman Speyer Properties LP defaulted. The sales are being brokered for Trigild by Los Angeles-based CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. The site is part of the 464-acre Playa Vista development in West Los Angeles, which is on land once owned by the Hughes Aircraft Co.
The sale was reported earlier today by Real Estate Alert. The three buyers are paying about $85 million for the properties, the newsletter said. Dorris declined to comment on the price.
Offices, Sound Stages
The portion that was in receivership has 575,000 square feet (53,400 square meters) of space and entitlements for 1.88 million square feet of office space, movie-production support facilities and sound stages, San Diego-based Trigild said in December.
Tishman Speyer, based in New York, and Chicago-based Walton Street bought the Campus at Playa Vista at the top of the U.S. real estate market in 2007. KeyBank National Association sued to foreclose against limited partnerships controlling the property, according to an Oct. 20 complaint.
The hangar where Hughes built the H-4 Hercules flying boat, nicknamed the Spruce Goose, in the late 1940s has been used in recent years as a soundstage for shooting movies, including last year¡¯s ¡°Avatar¡± and 1997¡¯s ¡°Titanic,¡± both directed by James Cameron.

153,"¡®Avatar¡¯ Makers Form Digital Venture Tied to Films With HP, Fox","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
The makers of ¡°Avatar¡± are teaming up with Hewlett-Packard Co. to create an immersive, digital entertainment experience to help market three future releases of the film saga.
The technology company, director James Cameron¡¯s Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox announced a five-year partnership in Las Vegas Wednesday to create a new entertainment experience to support the films. Features of the project weren¡¯t revealed.
¡°With the movie ¡®Avatar,¡¯ we looked to transform the in-theater experience for audiences,¡± Jon Landau, chief operating officer of Lightstorm and a co-producer of the film, said in an interview. ¡°We are now looking to make the same type of transformation with a digital experience.¡±
Released in 2009, the 3-D ¡°Avatar¡± became the biggest film in history with $2.78 billion in global ticket sales, according to Imdb.com. With a decade between the first and the last movies, digital marketing has become a must, Landau said.
¡°In order to build our universe we need to reach out,¡± said Landau.
Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, California, will provide cloud-computing services and data security for the ¡°Avatar¡± digital experience, and will manage and analyze the collected data, according to a statement.
The unnamed project will be introduced in time for the second ¡°Avatar¡± film, which is scheduled for release on Dec. 25, 2017, Landau said.
The sequels reunite some original cast members, including Sam Worthington, who plays the paraplegic marine who sent on a mission to the moon Pandora.
Sequel Dates
The third and fourth films will be released in 2018 and 2019, according to Imdb. The project will extend beyond 2019, when the pictures roll out to home viewers, Landau said. Production of the sequels is going as planned, he added.
The filmmakers are also working with Walt Disney Co. on a theme-park experience and Cirque du Soleil, which plans an ¡®Avatar¡¯ inspired show in November 2015.
While Disney isn¡¯t directly involved with the digital experience, Landau said the goal was that the whole ¡°Avatar ecosystem¡± would be connected."
154,¡®Avatar¡¯ Opens With $77 Million to Set Record for 3-D,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Dec. 21 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Avatar,¡± James Cameron¡¯s science-fiction epic, took in $232.2 million in worldwide ticket sales its opening weekend and set a record for a 3-D movie in the U.S. and Canada.
The News Corp. film led the box office with $77 million in U.S. ticket sales and had the second-best debut for a December release, Hollywood.com Box-Office said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
¡°Avatar,¡± Cameron¡¯s first movie since ¡°Titanic,¡± ranks among the most expensive ever made with an estimated budget of $230 million, according to the Internet Movie Database. The film, playing on 3,124 3-D screens at 2,032 locations, may take in as much as $400 million in theaters, estimates Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
¡°It was a terrific opening,¡± said Gitesh Pandya, editor of Box Office Guru LLC. ¡°People are really liking the film: 92 percent of people surveyed are recommending it to their friends.¡±
The previous record of $68.1 million for a 3-D opening was set by Walt Disney Co.¡¯s ¡°Up¡± this year, according to Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher in Sherman Oaks, California.
In ¡°Avatar,¡± an Earth corporation seeking rare minerals on a distant planet employs a private army to subdue the inhabitants. Australian actor Sam Worthington plays an ex-Marine who spies on the aliens by inhabiting a body cloned from their genetic material.
3-D Appeal
Cameron, 55, began writing the story in 1995 and spent 10 years developing technology, including a 3-D camera system, to create the world he imagined.
The movie may further convince studios and theater owners that 3-D movies help improve attendance, Cameron said in a Dec. 16 interview.
¡°It seems like with DVD sales down there¡¯s a renewed emphasis on the actual cinematic experience,¡± Cameron said. ¡°¡®Avatar¡¯ was absolutely intended to be that kind of movie and maybe demonstrate how 3-D can be an enabler of that.¡±
U.S. ticket sales are poised to surpass $10 billion this year, Hollywood.com Box-Office has projected. The take was aided by more than a dozen 3-D movies, including ¡°Up,¡± which went on to generate $293 million domestically. Theaters charge about a $3 per ticket premium for films in the format.
Twenty-two 3-D pictures are planned over the next two years, according to Los Angeles-based Exhibitor Relations Co.
¡®Sherlock Holmes¡¯
Imax Corp., based in Mississauga, Ontario, took in a record $9.5 million from ¡°Avatar¡± at 178 locations in the U.S. and Canada this weekend, according to a statement today. The film was shown in a record 261 theaters worldwide that use Imax¡¯s enhanced sound and image system.
¡°We virtually sold out every show in the world and you can¡¯t do better than that,¡± Imax Chief Executive Officer Richard Gelfond said in an interview today. ¡°There seems to be a rabid appetite for the Imax version of this film and it manifested itself in the box office results.¡±
Industry efforts to outfit theaters with equipment that can be used for 3-D have been hampered by funding delays. One group, Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, had set a November goal to raise $725 million.
¡°Avatar¡± may take in $320 million to $400 million domestically, according to Wible. ¡°Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,¡± is the top U.S. and Canadian film this year with $402 million in sales for Viacom Inc.¡¯s Paramount Pictures.
Cameron¡¯s film will face competition next week from New York-based Time Warner Inc.¡¯s ¡°Sherlock Holmes,¡± starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, to be released on Christmas Day.
¡®The Morgans¡¯
The other film put into wide release this weekend was the comedy ¡°Did You Hear About the Morgans?¡± starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant. The movie from Tokyo-based Sony Corp. was fourth with sales of $6.6 million. Parker and Grant play a bickering New York couple who are placed in a government protection program after witnessing a murder.
This is a ¡°poor opening and even though movies tend to have legs at this time of year I don¡¯t see this one becoming a winner anytime soon,¡± said Pandya. ¡°The reviews have been horrible.¡±
¡°The Princess and the Frog,¡± in first place last week, fell to second with $12.2 million in receipts. The movie from Burbank, California-based Disney, and drawn from the classic fairy tale, is set in New Orleans during the Jazz era. Oprah Winfrey and Terrence Howard are among those lending their voices.
Football Drama
¡°The Blind Side,¡± a football drama starring Sandra Bullock, dropped to third from second, with $10 million in receipts for Warner Bros. The movie has made $164.7 million in five weeks of release.
In fifth place was Summit Entertainment LLC¡¯s ¡°The Twilight Saga: New Moon.¡± The vampire movie had sales of $4.4 million and has made $274.6 million in five weeks of release.
Warner Bros.¡¯ ¡°Invictus¡± was sixth. The movie featuring Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela generated $4.2 million in sales. ¡°Invictus,¡± which was directed by Clint Eastwood and co-stars Matt Damon, follows Mandela¡¯s effort to use rugby to unite South Africa following the end of white minority rule.
News Corp, based in New York, rose 34 cents to $13.69 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The Class A shares have gained 51 percent this year.
Sales for the top 12 films rose 61 percent to $129.8 million from $80.7 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Year-to-date receipts total $9.96 billion, up 8.8 percent from a year earlier. Attendance is up 4.72 percent this year.

155,¡®Avengers¡¯ Breaks Record With $200.3 Million in Receipts,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 7 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Marvel¡¯s The Avengers¡± crushed U.S. box-office records with $207.4 million in weekend ticket sales, opening the summer movie season with a huge win for Walt Disney Co. following the mega-flop ¡°John Carter.¡±
¡°The Avengers¡± blew past the previous-best opening weekend of $169.2 million in the U.S. and Canada, set last year by ¡°Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,¡± researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in a statement, after yesterday¡¯s $200.3 million preliminary figure. Forecasts had ranged from $150 million to $170 million.
¡°Two hundred million is a staggering number,¡± said Jeff Bock, box-office analyst at researcher Exhibitor Relations Co. ¡°This is definitely the kind of momentum that¡¯s going to carry over and ride the wave through summer.¡±
The movie¡¯s performance validates Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger¡¯s strategy of focusing on fewer, more-expensive films with characters that can be marketed by Disney¡¯s merchandise, cable-television and theme-park arms. Iger paid $4.2 billion for Marvel Entertainment in 2009, gaining comic-book characters such as Thor, the Hulk and Captain America, and $7.01 billion for Pixar Animation Studio in 2006.
¡°The Avengers¡± is the first Marvel film Disney has distributed since buying the comic-book company. The numbers underscore Marvel¡¯s staying power and Disney¡¯s ability to capitalize on the brand, said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for distribution at Walt Disney Studios.
Beyond the box office, there is a ¡°ton of enterprise-wide value for ancillary business, whether it be consumer products or the networks,¡± Hollis said in an interview.
Merchandise Opportunities
Each $60 million in additional ticket sales exceeding forecasts for ¡°The Avengers¡± generates 1 cent a share in profit for Burbank, California-based Disney, Todd Juenger, an analyst with Bernstein Research in New York, wrote in a May 4 research report. That figure doesn¡¯t include the lift to home-video sales such as DVDs and cable television, consumer-product sales or other tie-ins with Disney properties.
A hit ¡°is usually a bigger deal for Disney than it would be for the other major studios,¡± Juenger wrote, citing the company¡¯s ¡°unparalleled ability to wring additional value.¡±
Disney bore the risks of its bet-big strategy with the March release ¡°John Carter,¡± which cost $250 million, according to Box Office Mojo, and failed to resonate with audiences. Rich Ross, the head of Disney¡¯s film unit, resigned the following month, and the company hasn¡¯t yet hired a replacement.
¡®Shot in Arm¡¯
Disney, which is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results tomorrow, has said it lost $200 million on the movie and as much as $120 million at the film unit in the period.
¡°This was a needed shot in the arm for Disney and its live-action business,¡± said Paul Sweeney, senior analyst with Bloomberg Industries in Skillman, New Jersey. ¡°This really validates the acquisition of Marvel Entertainment.¡±
Disney advanced 2.1 percent to $43.82 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 17 percent this year. The company releases Pixar¡¯s ¡°Brave¡± on June 22.
For other film studios, ¡°The Avengers¡± raises the competitive bar at the start the all-important summer season, which made up more than 40 percent of domestic sales last year.
Films scheduled in coming weeks include Warner Bros.¡¯ ¡°The Dark Knight Rises,¡± directed by Christopher Nolan, and Sony Corp.¡¯s ¡°Men in Black 3,¡± a sequel that reunites Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as government agents managing Earth¡¯s secret alien population.
Summer Sales
Summer ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast by Bock to surpass the record of $4.4 billion set last year. For all of 2011, sales were $10.2 billion. The full-year mark of $10.6 billion was set in 2009.
¡°The Avengers¡± helped push domestic box-office receipts to a 16 percent gain year-to-date, to $3.58 billion, according to Hollywood.com. Attendance is up 19 percent.
The movie brings together Marvel heroes featured singly in previous films. The Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America must overcome egos and discord to band together to fight an army led by Loki, the unscrupulous god of Norse mythology. The film stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson.
The movie, which has generated $654.8 million in sales worldwide, according to Hollywood.com, was the only new picture opening in wide release in the U.S. this weekend.
Crowd Mix
Disney¡¯s Hollis credited director Joss Whedon and the actors, as well as Marvel President Kevin Feige for weaving together the narratives of the multiple Marvel films leading up to this one, including the two ¡°Iron Man¡± movies, and last year¡¯s ¡°Captain America¡± and ¡°Thor.¡±
The international opening, as well as a Marvel record of $100 million in sponsorships, including Honda Motor Co.¡¯s Acura and Harley-Davidson Inc., helped generate interest and draw a diverse audience that was half over age 25 and 60 percent male, he said. Fifty-two percent of the gross was in 3-D theaters such as those using RealD Inc. systems, and 8 percent was in theaters equipped by Imax Corp., which ran out of tickets.
¡°You hope for a mix like this,¡± Hollis said. ¡°This is what you shoot for.¡±
RealD, based in Beverly Hills, California, added 2.2 percent to $11.38 in New York trading. Mississauga, Ontario-based Imax gained 3.3 percent to $24.70.
The huge opening leaves Disney well-positioned for three more films based on Avengers characters over the next two years.
Future Releases
¡°Iron Man 3¡± is scheduled for release in May 2013, ¡°Thor 2¡± in November 2013, and ¡°Captain America 2¡± is planned for April 2014, according to the website Imdb.com.
For ¡°The Avengers,¡± the company hasn¡¯t made any decisions regarding changes to the DVD or pay-per-view release schedule, Hollis said.
¡°We¡¯re too busy picking our jaws up off the ground,¡± Hollis said.
While there were no other new releases, among returning films Sony Corp.¡¯s ¡°Think Like a Man¡± dropped to second place with $8.1 million after two weeks in first. ¡°The Hunger Games¡± was third with $5.6 million. The movie has generated $380.6 million in domestic ticket sales for Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. since it was released on March 23.
Sony¡¯s animated ¡°The Pirates! Band of Misfits¡± was fourth, down from second place, with $5.5 million. The romantic drama ¡°The Lucky One¡± dropped to fifth with $5.4 million for Warner Bros.
Weekend revenue for the top 12 films surged 61 percent to $249.7 million from a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. The amounts below are based on actual ticket sales for May 4-6.

156,¡®Avengers¡¯ Chases ¡®Hunger Games¡¯ as Forecasts Hit Record,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 2 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Marvel¡¯s The Avengers¡± will probably surpass the $152.5 million debut of ¡°The Hunger Games,¡± giving the superhero film saga the biggest opening weekend for 2012.
Estimates for the Walt Disney Co. picture, featuring Iron Man, Thor and the Hulk, range from $150 million to a weekend record of $170 million. ¡°The Avengers¡± opens in U.S. theaters on May 4.
The tally for ¡°The Hunger Games¡± set the mark to beat for summer films. Exceeding that sum would give Disney bragging rights that may not be challenged until ¡°The Amazing Spider-Man¡± and ¡°The Dark Knight Rises¡± open in July. Studios try to manage expectations for their top films to avoid post-weekend disappointments on newscasts and websites.
¡°It¡¯s pretty much all about getting a great opening weekend story,¡± said Phil Contrino, editor of Boxoffice.com, an industry website. ¡°That¡¯s 100 percent understandable because they¡¯re accountable to the stockholders, so they can¡¯t go out there and be very bullish.¡±
Industry tracking puts the opening at $150 million-plus, the Hollywood Reporter said on May 1. Analysts are more bullish, with two including Contrino suggesting the movie may exceed the all-time weekend mark of $169.2 million set last year by the final ¡°Harry Potter¡± film.
¡°The Avengers¡± is benefiting from the popularity of previous movies based on the characters, including Robert Downey Jr.¡¯s two ¡°Iron Man¡± movies. The film had already generated $218 million overseas as of yesterday, setting weekend records in 12 countries including Australia, Brazil and Mexico, according to researcher Box Office Mojo.
Long Tale
¡°They¡¯ve been building this audience since the first ¡®Iron Man,¡¯¡± said Contrino, who pegs weekend sales at $170 million. ¡°Then there¡¯s ¡®Iron Man 2,¡¯ ¡®Thor,¡¯ ¡®The Hulk.¡¯ All of that built up goodwill.¡±
In ¡°The Avengers,¡± Marvel¡¯s superheroes unite to battle an army led by Loki, the evil god of Norse mythology. In addition to Downey, the cast includes Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L. Jackson.
Weekend sales of $163.9 million are forecast by the Hollywood Stock Exchange, a website that bases estimates on mock betting, while Matthew Harrigan, a Denver-based analyst for Wunderlich Securities, predicts $170 million.
Paul Roeder, a Disney spokesman, declined to comment on the forecasts. Shares of Disney, based in Burbank, California, gained 1.6 percent to $43.79 yesterday in New York. The stock has risen 17 percent this year, ranking seventh in the 16-stock Standard & Poor¡¯s Media Index.
Social-Media Buzz
Enthusiasm for the film¡¯s prospects is based in part on Facebook and Twitter activity. As of yesterday, ¡°The Avengers¡± had 1.33 million ¡°likes¡± on its official Facebook page and had generated 45,936 Twitter tweets. On the Monday before it hit theaters, ¡°The Hunger Games¡¯ had 2.99 million likes and had generated 34,476 tweets.
¡®¡®That says that the marketing plan is really working,¡¯¡¯ Contrino said. ¡®¡®People are aware of it.¡¯¡¯
¡®¡®The Hunger Games¡¯¡¯ had a similar buildup of expectations, with forecasts rising as its March 23 opening approached. The film, based on the Suzanne Collins novel about teens battling in a televised fight to the death, posted the third-best weekend debut and has taken in a total of $372.7 million in the U.S. and Canada, according to Box Office Mojo.
Advance Sales
At Fandango.com, the ticket-sales website owned by Comcast Corp., ¡®¡®The Avengers¡¯¡¯ accounted for about 91 percent of total purchases yesterday. At the same time in March, ¡®¡®The Hunger Games¡¯¡¯ generated 92 percent of sales, according to releases from the company.
¡®¡®The Avengers¡¯¡¯ is among an increasing number of movies that open first outside the U.S.
¡®¡®Battleship,¡¯¡¯ scheduled to open on May 18 in the U.S., has generated $170 million in foreign sales for Comcast¡¯s Universal Pictures since April 11, according to Box Office Mojo.
Viacom Inc.¡¯s Paramount Pictures, which previously held theatrical rights to Marvel films before Disney bought the company, took the same approach to ¡®¡®Thor¡± last year.
The film began playing on April 27 last year in foreign territories and opened in the U.S. and Canada on May 6.
Buzz from a film¡¯s sales abroad can enhance its prospects in the U.S. and Canada, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office unit of Hollywood.com. He is estimating opening weekend sales of $150 million.
¡°It raises the excitement level because it¡¯s being talked about all over the world,¡± Dergarabedian said. ¡°That¡¯s why I think we¡¯ll see more of this international-first strategy on certain key movies.¡±

157,¡®Avengers¡¯ Gamers on Facebook Get First Look at Movie Spot,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 5 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co. unveiled the latest ad for its May 4 movie release ¡°Marvel¡¯s The Avengers¡± inside a game on Facebook.com.
The commercial appears in the game ¡°Marvel: Avengers Alliance,¡± which Disney created for Facebook. Players who watch get a virtual gold bar to buy weapons and other products. Playing is free; the bars cost $1 for four.
¡°Marvel: Avengers Alliance,¡± has attracted 640,000 daily users, according to AppData, a researcher. It is part of a broader trend in which studios drum up interest for pictures by engaging potential ticket buyers online. Disney said it is the first time Marvel has used a game to introduce a movie ad.
¡°Disney is leveraging its assets in such an exciting way across multiple platforms,¡± said Jeff Gomez, founder of Starlight Runner Entertainment, which consults with companies on online strategies. ¡°Our tracking indicates it¡¯s been highly effective. They¡¯re going to reap rewards.¡±
¡°The Avengers¡± follows a team of Marvel superheroes battling to save the earth. It stars Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson, reprising their roles as Iron Man and the Black Widow from 2010¡¯s ¡°Iron Man 2,¡± which grossed $624 million worldwide for distributor Paramount Pictures on a budget of $200 million, according to Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher.
¡°We believe this game is the ideal platform for reaching a large and passionate Avengers fan base,¡± said Mike Rubinelli, a vice president of Playdom, the social-game company Disney acquired for $563 million in 2010.
¡®Captain America 2¡¯
This is the first Marvel movie marketed and distributed by Disney since it acquired the film and comic-book company for $4 billion in 2009. Previous Marvel films were distributed by other studios with licensing agreements.
The company today announced an April 2014 release date for ¡°Captain America 2,¡± sequel to a 2011 film that brought in $369 million in worldwide ticket sales.
Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.4 percent to $43.08 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 15 percent this year.

158,¡®Avengers¡¯ Has 2nd-Best Single-Day Gross of $80.5 Million,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 5 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co.¡¯s ¡°Marvel¡¯s The Avengers¡± earned $80.5 million yesterday in U.S. and Canadian theaters, making it the second-biggest single-day gross in box-office history, according to Hollywood.com Box-Office.
The superhero film featuring Iron Man, Thor and the Hulk is expected to earn between $150 million and a weekend record of $170 million, according to analysts¡¯ estimates. Time Warner Inc.¡¯s ¡°Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2¡± holds the single-day record at $91.1 million, box-officer tracker Hollywood.com said.
The movie ¡°will certainly wind up in the top five openings of all-time and could exceed ¡®Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2¡¯ and take the crown for the biggest opening weekend of all-time,¡± said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office unit of Hollywood.com, in an e-mail. Disney¡¯s mark may not be challenged until ¡°The Amazing Spider-Man¡± and ¡°The Dark Knight Rises¡± open in July.
He said ¡°Avengers¡± may best the last ¡°Harry Potter¡± based on Friday receipts, even after the midnight showings only tallied $18.7 million. He said IMAX Corp. may have accounted for 8 percent of that total, with showings ¡°virtually sold out¡± in all locations.
Previous Movies
¡°The Avengers¡± is benefiting from the popularity of previous movies based on the characters, including Robert Downey Jr.¡¯s two ¡°Iron Man¡± movies. The film already had taken in $304 million outside the U.S. and Canada as of yesterday, Disney said in an e-mailed statement.
In the film, Marvel¡¯s superheroes unite to battle an army led by Loki, the evil god of Norse mythology. In addition to Downey, the cast includes Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L. Jackson.
The movie received an A+ CinemaScore, which is an exit-polling service that asks moviegoers what they thought of the film, Dergarabedian said. Such a rating is quite rare, he said.

159,¡®Avengers¡¯ Proves Marvel Exceeds Iger¡¯s $4.2 Billion Cost,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 11 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Iger said Marvel Entertainment¡¯s value ¡°far exceeds¡± the $4.2 billion paid for the business after its latest film set a box-office record.
¡°¡®Avengers¡¯ I think speaks volumes in terms of, not only the value of Marvel, but the value that Marvel can create long-term,¡± Iger said in an interview yesterday with Bloomberg Television¡¯s Carol Massar. ¡°We sit here today with a very clear blueprint about how to create more value from Marvel over the years. Value that I believe will far exceed what we paid for Marvel a few years ago.¡±
¡°Marvel¡¯s The Avengers¡± generated a best-ever $207 million in ticket sales in its domestic debut last weekend, and its worldwide total now exceeds $775 million, according to Box Office Mojo, a film research website. It is the first Marvel film Disney distributed since purchasing the comic book publisher in 2009.
Iger, 61, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and television group co-Chairman Anne Sweeney appear today on Bloomberg Television¡¯s ¡°Inside Disney,¡± broadcast live from the company¡¯s Burbank, California, headquarters.
Disney¡¯s CEO, once a TV weatherman, said every project in the hit-or-miss film business is a nail-bitter.
¡°People would be surprised how late in the life of some of these projects, there¡¯s still so much work to be done,¡± Iger said. ¡°The uncertainty about whether it will be great or not lasts, exists I guess, pretty late in the process.¡±
¡®Give it a Shot¡¯
Disney¡¯s March science-fiction release ¡°John Carter¡± led to an $84 million operating loss at the film studio for the second quarter ended March 31. Studio chairman Rich Ross resigned in April.
Iger said he felt the $250 million movie was ¡°very challenged¡± after viewing it prior to release. The company continued to promote it.
¡°I felt that given the size of the investment that we owed it to ourselves to at least give it the shot it deserved,¡± he said.
Screening an early cut of the ¡°The Avengers,¡± Iger said ¡°we had a pretty good sense that we had a very strong movie on our hands. We didn¡¯t know it was going to break all the records that it¡¯s broken.¡±
Disney is working on a sequel to ¡°The Avengers,¡± racing to get more movie-related merchandise in stores and planning to get the characters into its theme parks, Iger said May 8 when the company announced a 21 percent increase in quarterly profit.
Merchandise Potential
Iger, who also engineered the $7 billion purchase of the Pixar animation studio in 2006, said yesterday he doesn¡¯t expect every film to have the sequel and merchandising potential of ¡°The Avengers.¡±
¡°The creative process is best served by having a goal to just making something great, and if it happens to be something that works worldwide or something that spans multiple businesses here, or something that will live forever in multiple ways, fantastic,¡± he said. ¡°Making a great movie is a difficult thing. I believe that we would only make it more difficult if we told all the movie makers that you have to check every box before we do this.¡±
Disney rose 0.6 percent yesterday to an all-time closing high of $45.28. The stock has gained 21 percent this year.

160,¡®Avengers¡¯ Sets Second-Weekend Record With $103.2 Million,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 14 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Marvel¡¯s The Avengers¡± broke another box-office record, taking in $103.1 million for Walt Disney Co. in its second weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters.
The film surpassed the $75.6 million benchmark for a second-weekend performance, set in 2009 by ¡°Avatar,¡± researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed statement. Last week, ¡°The Avengers¡± smashed the opening-weekend record with $207.4 million in domestic receipts. The vampire comedy ¡°Dark Shadows,¡± starring Johnny Depp, opened in second place with $29.7 million.
The records raise the prospect studios will top their previous best yearly sales of $10.6 billion set in 2009, Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com Box-Office, said in an interview. Sales for 2012 are up 18 percent over 2011 and attendance is ahead 20 percent, according to Hollywood.com. Opening May 25 is Sony Corp.¡¯s ¡°Men in Black 3,¡± forecast by Boxoffice.com to generate $205 million in domestic sales.
¡°¡®Avengers¡¯ still remains the must-see movie of the weekend,¡± said Phil Contrino, editor at Boxoffice.com ¡°There is a great deal of positive word of mouth surrounding the film and the must-see factor is definitely there.¡±
¡°Avengers¡± is the first movie ever to post back-to-back weekends of $100 million-plus sales, Hollywood.com said. The film topped $1 billion in sales worldwide yesterday, 19 days after its U.S. release, Hollywood.com said.
¡®Dark Shadows¡¯
Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger told investors on a conference call last week the company will turn ¡°The Avengers¡± into a franchise. The studio also will continue to draw individually from the characters for more films, he said. Disney is developing a third ¡°Iron Man¡± movie and a sequel to ¡°Thor,¡± the hammer-wielding Norse demigod also featured in ¡°The Avengers.¡±
In ¡°The Avengers,¡± several Marvel heroes band together to fight an army of aliens led by Loki, also a character from Norse mythology. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.
¡°Dark Shadows,¡± from Time Warner Inc.¡¯s Warner Bros., is inspired by the 1960s daytime television show about a New England family entangled with vampires, ghosts and werewolves. Director Tim Burton¡¯s tongue-in-cheek interpretation also features Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter and Eva Green.
Contrino said he was expecting ¡°Dark Shadows¡± to open with about $35 million in receipts, though the popularity of ¡°Avengers¡± weighed on that number.
¡°Dark Shadows¡± was the only film to open in wide release.
¡®The Hunger Games¡¯
Among returning movies, Sony¡¯s romantic comedy ¡°Think Like a Man¡± dropped to third place from second with $5.8 million.
¡°The Hunger Games¡± was fourth with $4.5 million. The movie, based on the Suzanne Collins novel, has generated $387 million in domestic ticket sales for Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. since it was released on March 23.
Warner Bros.¡¯s romantic drama, ¡°The Lucky One,¡± finished fifth with $4.1 million.
Weekend revenue for the top 12 films rose 26 percent to $162.3 million from a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. The amounts below are based on actual ticket sales for May 11, May 12 and yesterday.

161,¡®Avengers¡¯ Takes in $77.2 Million to Lead for Second Weekend,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
¡°Avengers: Age of Ultron¡± overpowered the competition at the box office for a second straight weekend, as the Walt Disney Co. film produced $77.2 million in ticket sales at U.S. and Canadian theaters.
¡°Hot Pursuit,¡± a police comedy with Sofia Vergara and Reese Witherspoon, opened in second place with sales of $13.3 million for Time Warner Inc.¡¯s Warner Bros., researcher Rentrak Corp. said Sunday in an e-mailed statement. ¡°Ex-Machina,¡± an independent film about a computer programmer and a sexy android, expanded to 2,004 locations and took in $3.5 million.
With the action genre mostly to itself early in the summer film season, ¡°Age of Ultron¡± set a hot pace with a $191.3 million domestic opening May 1-3, the second-biggest debut ever. It faces its first fresh competition next week with ¡°Mad Max: Fury Road¡± from Warner Bros. Universal Pictures¡¯s ¡°Pitch Perfect 2¡± also may draw significant traffic, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Rentrak.
¡°It will be pretty tough for ¡®Age of Ultron¡¯ to maintain its top spot,¡± he said. ¡°But that¡¯s fairly insignificant balanced against how hugely successful this film has been around the world.¡±
Worldwide Sales
The movie has generated $312.9 million in domestic sales and $875.3 million worldwide, Disney said in an e-mailed statement Sunday. It opens May 12 in China, the second-biggest film market behind the U.S.
Even so, the film¡¯s weekend domestic take did miss estimates of about $84 million, according to BoxOffice.com.
¡°Avengers: Age of Ultron¡± reunites Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., with Captain America and other Marvel comic-book superheroes in a film that cost about $250 million to produce, according to researcher Box Office Mojo.
When Tony Stark, Iron Man¡¯s alter ego, tries to jump start a dormant peacekeeping program, the villainous Ultron, played by James Spader, emerges. The film introduces new characters such as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, and sets up story lines for new installments that are planned in coming years.
Familiar Faces
Actors Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson reprise their roles from the first ¡°Avengers¡± film.
¡°Hot Pursuit,¡± the only new film in wide release, teams Witherspoon as a straight-arrow cop trying to protect the widow of a drug boss, played by Vergara, as they¡¯re chased across Texas.
Critics didn¡¯t think much of the picture, giving it a 7 percent positive rating at Rottentomatoes.com, which compiles reviews into a single numerical score.
Vergara¡¯s popularity could counter the critics. As star of the ABC comedy ¡°Modern Family,¡± she is the highest-paid actress on television, according to Forbes, a title held for three straight years.
The PG-13 film was made for about $35 million, according to Box Office Mojo. It was expected to produce domestic weekend revenue of $18 million, according to BoxOffice.com.
Artificial Intelligence
Among returning films, ¡°Ex Machina¡± was expanded from 1,279 theaters last week and landed in sixth place, according to Rentrak. It was first released on April 10 and is being distributed in the U.S. by A24 and Universal Pictures. BoxOffice.com had predicted $2.5 million in weekend sales.
Filmed in the U.K. and Norway, ¡°Ex Machina¡± marks the directorial debut of British-born Alex Garland, who also wrote the picture. His previous writing credits include ¡°28 Days Later,¡± the 2003 zombie drama.
Domhnall Gleeson stars as Caleb, a programmer who wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain retreat of the reclusive CEO of the world¡¯s largest Internet company.
He finds he is part of an experiment with the world¡¯s first artificial intelligence, the beautiful android Ava played by Alicia Vikander. His job is to find out if Ava is self-aware or just a great robot.
¡°This is a rare commercial film in which every scene, sequence, composition and line deepens the screenplay¡¯s themes,¡± Matt Zoller Seitz writes at RogerEbert.com. ¡°When the bloody ending arrives, it seems less predictable than inevitable and right, as in myths, legends and Bible stories.¡±
Positive Reviews
Rottentomatoes gave the film a 91 percent positive rating, with 162 of 178 critics providing favorable notices. It was made for about 11 million euros ($12 million), according to Imdb.com, and had generated $21 million in worldwide revenue heading into the weekend, according to Box Office Mojo.
Weekend sales for the top 10 films fell 5 percent to $117.6 million from $123.8 million a year earlier, Rentrak said. Sales for the year to date have increased 5.8 percent to $3.67 billion.
The following table has U.S. movie box-office figures provided by studios to Rentrak. The amounts are based on actual ticket sales for May 8 and May 9, with estimates for Sunday.

162,¡®Awful¡¯ Jobs Fail to Kill Rate-Rise Expectations: Canada Credit,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 9 (Bloomberg) -- The first monthly decline in Canada¡¯s employment this year failed to dissuade bond traders from expecting another interest-rate increase by the Bank of Canada next month, though the chances are diminishing.
The odds of a 0.25 percentage point boost stood at 60 percent after the jobs report on Aug. 6, Bank of Nova Scotia data showed. In the days before the report, probabilities ranged from 62 percent to 68 percent. Bank of Canada policy makers next meet to decide monetary policy on Sept. 8.
¡°Despite the Canadian job losses, Canada¡¯s economy has added more than 200,000 jobs over the past six months, with the unemployment rate down significantly from its recessionary peak,¡± Mohammed Ahmed, a Toronto-based rates strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in an interview.
A September increase may likely be the last this year. Chances of a boost at the central bank¡¯s October and December meetings fell to 30 percent, from almost 40 percent earlier two weeks ago, the Bank of Nova Scotia data showed.
The yield on the December 2010 bankers¡¯ acceptances contract ended last week at 1.28 percent, up 3 basis points since July 19, the day before Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney raised rates for the second time in less than two months, to 0.75 percent.
¡®Sloppy¡¯ Data
¡°Recent data has been to the sloppy end, but are not enough yet to cause the Bank of Canada to materially change the view put forth in July,¡± David Watt, the senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada, the nation¡¯s biggest bank, wrote in an e-mail. He predicts the central bank will raise rates in September before pausing later this year.
Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors demand to own the debt of Canada¡¯s corporations rather than its federal government shrank 4 basis points last week to 147 basis points, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The spread on the bank¡¯s broad global company debt index narrowed 2 basis points to 175 basis points, or 1.75 percentage points.
Yields fell to 3.9 percent on average from 3.93 percent on July 30. The securities have return 5.21 percent this year, including reinvested interest, lagging behind the 7.14 percent gain for the broad index.
The spread on Canada¡¯s provincial bonds narrowed 2 basis points to 59 basis points. The securities have returned 4.96 percent this year, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. The nation¡¯s government bonds have gained 4.99 percent in 2010.
Jobs Report
Canada¡¯s sovereign debt got a boost after the jobs report, as the yield on the benchmark two-year bond fell as much as 10 basis points, the most since June 29, to 1.426 percent. The price of the 2 percent security rose 16 cents to C$101.14.
Canada will auction C$3 billion ($2.9 billion) of two-year bonds on Aug. 11, according to a statement last week on the Bank of Canada¡¯s website. The securities mature in December 2012.
The rally was mostly a response to the U.S. jobs figures, said Ahmed. U.S. nonfarm payrolls fell 131,000 in July after a revised cut of 221,000 in June, the Labor Department reported last week. The median forecast of 84 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 65,000 reduction.
¡°The U.S. number was just awful,¡± Blake Jespersen, director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal, said by telephone from Toronto. He said he expects Canada¡¯s central bank to raise rates in September before pausing at the October and December meetings.
Dealer-Offered Rates
The three-month Canadian dealer-offered rate, a proxy for the cost of bank funding over that period, fell on Aug. 6 only for the second time since June, to 1.049 percent, from 1.05 percent the day before, the highest since February 2009.
The three-month CDOR reached 5.07 percent in September 2007, the highest rate in more than four years, then plummeted to 0.43 percent two years later amid the global credit crisis.
On June 1, Carney became the first central banker in the Group of Seven to lift borrowing costs since July 2008, when he increased the benchmark rate to 0.5 percent. Carney followed up on July 20 with a 0.25 point boost, saying that further action would be ¡°weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments.¡±
Full-time employment decreased by 139,000 in July, Statistics Canada said, partly offset by a 129,700 increase in part-time jobs. Employment in educational services fell 65,300, and jobs in finance, insurance, real estate and leasing were down 29,800.
The Canadian employment data had only a ¡°minor impact¡± on Bank of Canada expectations, Camilla Sutton, the director of currency strategy in Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia, wrote in an e-mail. ¡°The large drop in education has many speculating there is an issue with calculating the seasonality of these jobs.¡±

163,¡®B Is for Buffett¡¯ in Page¡¯s Plan to Mold Google After Berkshire,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Google Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Page speaks affectionately of fellow billionaire Warren Buffett¡¯s approach to business. With the decision to restructure the Internet-search giant, Page is putting Buffett¡¯s influence into practice.
Page on Monday said he¡¯s restructuring Google so that all units outside its main Web businesses like search, advertising, YouTube and mobile software will be broken off and run independently. Page will be CEO of the new holding company, called Alphabet Inc., while longtime deputy Sundar Pichai will become CEO of Google. Google Ventures, research lab Google X, thermostat maker Nest and life sciences company Calico are among those to be owned by Alphabet and managed separately.
The new structure takes a page from Buffett, 84, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is a holding company for disparate businesses ranging from insurance and railroads to running shoes and ice cream. In the past five decades, he¡¯s built one of the largest businesses in the world by eschewing fads, buying when others sell, and taking a long-term approach to investing. Through 2014, Berkshire averaged annual returns of almost 22 percent, more than double the Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index.
¡°They look at Warren as a hero and Berkshire as a template,¡± said Steve Wallman, a Middleton, Wisconsin-based money manager who has invested in Berkshire since 1982 and bought stock in Apple Inc. in late 2003. He¡¯s not a Google shareholder, but says he wishes he were.
Fellow executives in the technology industry also noted the similarities to Berkshire.
¡°Google¡¯s Alphabet sounds like a 21st-century Berkshire Hathaway, but with a lot of very large venture bets,¡± Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn Corp., said on Twitter.
Quoting Buffett
In a letter to potential shareholders in 2004 ahead of Google¡¯s initial public offering, Page and co-founder Sergey Brin quoted Buffett when outlining the company¡¯s long-term focus.
¡°Much of this was inspired by Warren Buffett¡¯s essays in his annual reports and his ¡®An Owner¡¯s Manual¡¯ to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders,¡± the letter said, in the lone footnote at the bottom of the statement.
A hallmark of Buffett¡¯s approach has been to let management teams run their units independently. Under Page¡¯s structure for the newly created Alphabet, Pichai takes over as CEO of Google; former Apple executive Tony Fadell leads Nest, which Google purchased for $3.2 billion in 2014; and former Genentech Inc. CEO Art Levinson is leading Calico.
Day to Day
The new structure allows Page, 42, to offload some of the day-to-day operational responsibilities of running the company, while remaining in charge of overseeing the allocation of resources to the different businesses. It¡¯s a similar role that Buffett plays from Berkshire¡¯s headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska.
In an October interview with the Financial Times, Page said he looks to Buffett for ideas
Buffett has never been a command-and-control-type CEO. The decentralized structure has allowed him to keep the staff at the company¡¯s headquarters to about two dozen, even as Berkshire has grown to employ more than 300,000 people across more than 80 subsidiaries like auto insurer Geico and railroad BNSF.
Capital Deployment
His main charge has been figuring out how to deploy the company¡¯s capital. Berkshire doesn¡¯t pay a dividend and it rarely repurchases stock, which supplies Buffett with billions of dollars annually to put back into existing businesses or to make new investments. On Monday, he announced one of his biggest deals ever, a $37.2 billion takeover of Precision Castparts Corp., a manufacturer of parts for the aerospace industry.
¡°Warren says, ¡®Send the money to Omaha,¡¯¡± said Wallman, the money manager. ¡°They¡¯re saying send the money here and we¡¯ll do capital deployment in the same fashion -- in the spirit of Warren Buffett, but in the areas that they understand.¡±
In an October interview with the Financial Times, Page said he looks to Buffett for ideas. ¡°One thing we¡¯re doing is providing long-term, patient capital,¡± Page told the FT.
Still, there are differences. Buffett has avoided technology investments for most of his career and focused on buying businesses with durable competitive advantages. And he¡¯s rarely built businesses from scratch.
Driverless Cars
Under the new structure, Alphabet will still get almost all its revenue and profit from Google. The company has been using the cash from the business to fund its other investments, whether it¡¯s acquisitions such as Nest, or research efforts in driverless cars, high-speed Internet service or health-care products.
Technology companies have attempted this strategy in the past with little success, according to David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. International Business Machines Corp., Nokia Oyj and Hewlett-Packard Co. have over the past several decades added businesses, then sold them off when challenges arise.
Unlike Berkshire, which typically buys well-established companies with steady cash flow, Page must manage a conglomerate tasked with creating hit new technology products.
¡°You have to be able to manage the innovation process and decide what investments are worth making and which ones are not,¡± Yoffie said. ¡°The history of this in the technology industry is littered with failure.¡±

164,Ex-Haiti Dictator Duvalier Returns Amid Vote Disarray,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier returned from a 25-year exile as the country faces an electoral crisis following last year¡¯s earthquake that killed more than 300,000 people, the Nouvelliste reported.
Duvalier, also known as ¡°Baby Doc,¡± fled to Paris during a 1986 rebellion. The daily newspaper did not give further details.
His return comes as Haiti faces a political standoff over the disputed first round of presidential elections held Nov. 28. The second-round runoff, which had been scheduled for today, was postponed after the Organization of American States recommended that ruling party candidate Jude Celestin withdraw from the contest after protesters alleged his party rigged the vote.
The OAS report was given to the Associated Press and the Washington-based Center for Economic Policy and Research before it was submitted to the government of Rene Preval on Jan. 13.
A draft of the report published on the center¡¯s website recommends Celestin, of Preval¡¯s Inite party, withdraw from the race to open the way for a runoff between frontrunner and former first lady Mirland Manigat and Haitian pop star Michel Martelly.
Martelly supporters led violent protests after the candidate alleged ballot rigging and vowed to contest first round results that placed Celestin ahead of him with a less than 1 percentage point advantage.
OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza will visit Haiti tomorrow to discuss the report with Preval and Haitian electoral officials, according to an e-mailed statement.
The government has given no date for the postponed second-round vote, which would be held as the country battles a spreading cholera epidemic that has killed 3,790 and hospitalized more than 103,532, according to Haiti¡¯s health ministry.
The motive for Duvalier¡¯s return is not immediately clear. He ruled Haiti for 15 years after the 1971 death of his autocratic father Francois Duvalier, known as ¡°Papa Doc.¡±
Duvalier¡¯s secret police force, known as Tonton Macoutes, was accused of torturing and killing dissidents. After Duvalier¡¯s ouster, his opponents targeted the dictator¡¯s supporters and secret police for revenge, destroying their homes in the so-called dechoukaj, or ¡°uprooting.¡±

165,"Dexia to Set Up ¡®Bad Bank¡¯ With France, Belgium Guarantees","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Dexia SA, Belgium¡¯s biggest bank, plans to pool its troubled assets into a ¡°bad bank¡± with Belgian and French government guarantees to protect depositors and its municipal-lending business.
The Belgian-French lender bailed out by the two governments in 2008 will put its ¡°legacy¡± division, which held 113 billion euros ($150 billion) of assets at the end of June, into the bad bank, Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme told reporters in Brussels yesterday. Finance Minister Didier Reynders said details of the plan will be released after talks with partners.
¡°What we¡¯re looking for is not to spend taxpayers¡¯ money on a dossier such as this one,¡± Reynders said. ¡°Our wish is to consolidate, reinforce and safeguard the banking activity in Belgium, as our colleagues will do in France.¡±
The creation of a separate entity with government guarantees may help shield Dexia¡¯s banking units and avoid a repeat of the 2008 taxpayer-funded capital infusion. Belgium and France said yesterday that they will take ¡°all necessary measures¡± to protect clients and will guarantee Dexia¡¯s loans. Both governments have stakes in the bank following its 2008 bailout.
Dexia¡¯s board met on Oct. 3 to discuss a possible breakup of the lender after Europe¡¯s debt crisis reduced its ability to obtain funding, said three people with knowledge of the talks, who declined to be identified because the negotiations are private. A breakup would mark the clearest evidence yet that the banking crisis spurred by the sovereign-debt woes is spreading to the core of the euro region.
Dexia's Shares
Dexia¡¯s shares, which yesterday dropped the most in three years, rebounded in early trading today. The stock gained 9.1 percent to 1.10 euros at 9:04 a.m. in Brussels, after plunging 22 percent yesterday.
Belgian bonds sank and the cost of insuring Belgian government debt with credit-default swaps surged to a record on concern Dexia¡¯s possible breakup will increase the country¡¯s debt load, the third-highest in the euro region.
The extra yield investors demand to hold Belgian 10-year bonds instead of German bunds of similar maturity widened 29 basis points to 210, the most since Sept. 14. Credit-default swap contracts on Belgium climbed to a record 309 basis points, according to CMA prices.
Belgium¡¯s credit rating, now the second-highest investment grade, has a negative outlook at Standard & Poor¡¯s and Fitch Ratings, while debt-insurance costs indicate France¡¯s AAA rating is the weakest of the six top-rated euro-area nations.
¡®Negative Pressure¡¯
Moody¡¯s Investors Service warned yesterday that euro-area nations with ratings below the top AAA level may face downgrades, saying ¡°all but the strongest euro-area sovereigns are likely to face sustained negative pressure on their ratings.¡± Moody¡¯s yesterday lowered its rating on Italy for the first time in almost two decades on concern the government will struggle to reduce its debt.
For Dexia, ¡°the fact that two countries are involved, both under pressure from rating agencies, makes it even more difficult,¡± said Benoit Petrarque, an Amsterdam-based analyst at Kepler Capital Markets with a ¡°hold¡± rating on the shares. ¡°We are not in 2008 anymore, when you could just inject multibillions of cash.¡±
Prime Minister Leterme said yesterday that there¡¯s ¡°no reason justifying¡± Dexia Bank Belgium¡¯s clients pulling deposits from the bank. Belgium guarantees that no client ¡°will lose a single eurocent,¡± he said.
Asset-Management Division
The lender may hive off its French municipal loan book into a venture funded by state-owned La Banque Postale and Caisse des Depots et Consignations, and seek buyers for its Belgian bank, Denizbank AS in Turkey and its asset-management division, one of the people with knowledge of the talks said.
Dexia posted a 4 billion-euro loss for the second quarter, the biggest in its history, after writing down the value of its Greek debt. Once the world¡¯s biggest lender to municipalities, it received a 6 billion-euro bailout from Belgium, France and its largest shareholders in September 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
Moody¡¯s put Dexia¡¯s three main operating units on review for a downgrade on Oct. 3 on concern the lender was struggling to fund itself.
¡°Dexia has experienced further tightening in its access to market funding,¡± Moody¡¯s said in a statement.
Wholesale Funding
Dexia emerged from the 1996 merger of Credit Local de France and Credit Communal de Belgique SA, the biggest municipal lenders in their respective countries. Unlike Credit Local de France, which relied exclusively on wholesale funding for its lending, the Belgian firm also operated a retail bank in Belgium and a private bank in Luxembourg.
That reliance on wholesale funding hobbled the bank as money markets seized up after Lehman collapsed, and Dexia turned to emergency funding from central banks. It was the biggest euro-area user of emergency loans from the U.S. Federal Reserve, borrowing a $58.5 billion as of Dec. 31, 2008, according to a Bloomberg News compilation of data obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, months of litigation and an act of Congress.
In September 2008, France and Belgium led the first rescue of Dexia, buying a combined 3 billion euros of stock. The bank¡¯s existing shareholders, which include Caisse des Depots et Consignations and Belgium¡¯s Holding Communal SA, provided an additional 3 billion euros.
First Bailout
Less than a month later, Dexia also obtained as much as 150 billion euros of debt guarantees from France, Belgium and Luxembourg, of which it tapped a maximum of about 96 billion euros in May 2009. The bank stopped issuing government-backed debt in June 2010. It still had 29 billion euros outstanding at the end of last month.
Reynders said yesterday the guarantees that will be provided now will be ¡°inferior¡± to the ones granted in 2008, when Belgium¡¯s share exceeded 90 billion euros.
He also said that Belgium has ¡°no intention¡± of chalking up losses, adding that it will collect a fee in return for the guarantees. Dexia paid 489 million euros last year for use of guarantees, according to company filings.
Dexia¡¯s legacy division, which will be folded into the bad bank, has a pool of long-term assets that were put together so they could be financed with earlier debt guarantees. The division was created to meet European Union demands that earlier debt guarantees not be used to finance its commercial businesses and give investors greater clarity about its capacity to generate profits.
Municipal Loans
At the end of June, the division included 95 billion euros of bonds with an average maturity of almost 13 years and $9.5 billion of mostly U.S. residential-mortgage backed securities, the majority of which were sold in July.
It also had 11 billion euros of municipal loans in countries where Dexia has halted operations.
Dexia may also transfer an additional 50 billion euros of assets from its municipal-lending units in Italy and Spain into the bad bank. Dexia agreed to dispose of its controlling stakes in Rome-based Dexia Crediop SpA and its joint venture with Barcelona-based Banco de Sabadell SA to win European Commission approval for its 2008 bailout. Moody¡¯s lowered Italy¡¯s debt rating by three levels to A2 late yesterday.
¡°In the current environment, the size of the non-strategic asset portfolio impacts the group structurally,¡± Dexia said in a statement yesterday. ¡°This is why the board of directors asked the CEO, in consultation with the relevant governments and the supervisory authorities, to prepare the necessary measures to resolve the structural problems.¡±

166,"¡®Bad¡¯ Winter Grains in Russia Reach Up to 6%, Center Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 11 (Bloomberg) -- Between 3 percent and 6 percent of winter-grain plantings are ¡°bad¡± in southern and central Russia, according to the Federal Hydrometeorological Center.
Losses may range between 10 percent and 13 percent in some parts of European Russia, including Tambov, Penza, Volgograd and the Republic of Kalmykia, Anna Strashnaya, head of agro-meteorological forecasts at the Moscow-based center, said by telephone today.
The Krasnodar and Stavropol regions, Russia¡¯s traditional breadbasket, have no bad winter plantings, according to Strashnaya. Farms will probably reseed winter crops in areas where plantings are poor, she said.
Russia was hit by its worst drought in at least 50 years last year, which cut the grain harvest by 37 percent to 60.9 million metric tons. This year cold and rainy weather delayed spring sowing by two weeks, according to the Agriculture Ministry.
The pace of spring sowing in the North Caucasus region is behind schedule, mainly because of local rainfall in May¡¯s first 10 days, Strashnaya said. Rains lasted for between five and seven days in the area, exceeding the norm by up to five times, she said.
Between 45 millimeters (1.8 inches) and 85 millimeters of rain fell across the region in the period and the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania received up to 107 millimeters, according to Strashnaya.
The sowing delay may have no effect on crops in Russia because weather will improve, helping plantings to mature, Strashnaya said. She also put the probability of a repetition in 2011 of last year¡¯s drought at less than 20 percent.
¡°We do not expect such a thing yet,¡± she said.

167,¡®Bake Sale Ban¡¯ Rhetoric Swells Over Obama School Snacks Rules,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Special-education students at Tooele High School in northwest Utah who rely on weekly bake sales to pay for field trips and supplies may have to go without.
Federal regulators, fresh off a contentious nutritional overhaul of U.S. school meals that replaced fried chicken patties with chef salads, are now preparing the first standards for snacks, sodas and other foods sold outside of regularly scheduled lunch and breakfast. That means vending machines, concession stands and some types of PTA fundraisers during school hours may be forced to cut back the calories.
¡°We have Washington deciding if you can hold a bake sale,¡± Utah state Representative Ken Ivory, a Republican, said in an interview. ¡°They¡¯ve overstepped their bounds.¡±
The American Frozen Food Institute, a McLean, Virginia-based trade group that represents 90 percent of U.S. frozen-food production, said the fight for candy bars and snack cakes may be more fierce than President Barack Obama¡¯s two-year battle over school entrees, which led to congressional intervention, rule rewrites and a compromise on categorizing pizza as a vegetable.
Danny Fisher, an author and 42-year-old mother raising five boys in Zanesville, Ohio, said too much emphasis is being put on limiting foods when the focus should be on increasing exercise.
¡°The idea of banning unhealthy food choices is paramount to Prohibition,¡± Fisher said in an interview by e-mail. ¡°We all know how well that worked.¡±
Domino¡¯s, Doritos
The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which led to regulations last month for lunches and breakfasts, also outlines requirements for the Agriculture Department to reset nutrition standards for items sold during the school day, known as ¡°competitive foods.¡± The agency has jurisdiction as it oversees the federal school-lunch program, which provides low-cost and free lunches in public and non-profit private schools.
¡°We hope to publish the proposed rule this spring,¡± said Aaron Lavallee, a USDA spokesman, who wouldn¡¯t elaborate on the department¡¯s plans.
Based on guidelines in the law, changes to the competitive foods rules may affect schools¡¯ activities clubs or sports teams that resell purchased goods, such as Nestle SA candy bars and other sweets to help pay for supplies. The proposal also would have to set nutritional limits for food and beverages in vending machines such as PepsiCo Inc.¡¯s Doritos and fast-food items sold in the cafeteria, such as Domino¡¯s Pizza slices that students buy with pocket money.
These foods may have to meet fat, calorie, sodium or other requirements, possibly replacing French fries and chips with granola bars and corn nuts. Exemptions will be allowed for infrequent, school-sponsored fundraisers. The threshold for such exceptions is still to be decided by regulators.
Seeking Balance
James Martinez, who has 11-year-old stepson, said he is in favor of the new nutrition standards.
¡°You don¡¯t want to be Draconian, but you do want to lead by example,¡± said Martinez, who is also a spokesman for the National Parent Teacher Association in Alexandria, Virginia, in an interview. ¡°There needs to be a balance.¡±
Industry lobbying over the lunch standards led Congress to block an earlier USDA proposal that would have set limits on French fries and starchy vegetables, and increased the amount of tomato sauce required in pizza. The new rules for competitive foods will create controversy as well because schools rely on such products for fundraisers, said Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington consumer advocacy group.
New rules for competitive foods, which would be the first since 1979, are necessary to ensure schools don¡¯t undermine parents¡¯ efforts to provide better nutrition at home, she said.
¡®Misplaced Overregulation¡¯
¡°It¡¯s a shame that schools have to raise money, but there¡¯s no reason to turn to fundraisers that undermine health,¡± Wootan said. ¡°There¡¯s no need to sell a candy bar when you could sell calendars or light bulbs or fruit baskets.¡±
The proposal would be intended to curb child obesity -- a priority of First Lady Michelle Obama, who campaigned to get the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act passed. Some lawmakers and educators said they are concerned that schools will lose revenue as students may be less apt to buy healthier fare or pay the higher prices likely to be charged.
Some schools generated as much as $125,000 a year from selling competitive foods, according to an August 2005 report by the Government Accountability Office.
The ¡°misplaced overregulation¡± may squelch income used by schools already facing the $3.2 billion cost of adopting the lunch and breakfast requirements, according to Anne Bryant, executive director of the National School Boards Association.
Higher-Priced Foods
The proposal may also create financial burdens for schools to implement and for parents alike, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank D. Lucas, a Republican from Oklahoma, said in a Feb. 3 letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
¡°The current economic climate is one in which it is of the utmost importance to protect schools and working families from dramatically increased costs in the form of higher food costs and logistical demands on schools,¡± Lucas said in the letter, which was also signed by the top Democrat on the committee, Representative Collin Peterson of Minnesota. ¡°The department should carefully consider the cost versus benefit of mandating schools to sell higher priced products or different products for the reimbursable and a la carte lines.¡±
U.S. law currently restricts few competitive foods, such as gum, from being offered in cafeterias during breakfast and lunch. Educators have been free to sell Domino¡¯s Pizza or Taco Bell products on the side as an alternative to the day¡¯s lunch, or have gym room vending machines stocked with Doritos. Almost half of elementary school students were able to buy unhealthy snacks in the 2009-2010 year, according to a study published Feb. 6 in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
¡®Smart Slice Pizza¡¯
At Lincoln Public Schools in Nebraska, high school students can buy hamburgers, oven-baked fries, dessert and other items a la carte. Mandating healthier fare may drive students to buy it off-site, Edith Zumwalt, nutrition services director for the school system, said in an interview.
¡°If they don¡¯t get food they want, they just leave,¡± said Zumwalt. ¡°That¡¯s more trouble.¡±
Some changes already have been made. Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo and Cadbury Schweppes Plc in 2006 agreed to halt almost all soft drink sales in elementary and middle schools, and also to limit soda sales in high schools to diet drinks, under a deal brokered by former President Bill Clinton and the American Heart Association.
Domino¡¯s Pizza Inc., which sells its Smart Slice to about 2 percent of the school lunch pizza market, already meets or exceeds the anticipated USDA standards, Tim McIntyre, a spokesman for the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based company, said in an e-mail. The sauce and pepperoni have less sodium, he said.
Sweets Sell
By 2007, more than 30 states had adopted standards for foods sold outside of the federal lunch program, according to a 2009 study by Samuels & Associates, a consulting company in Oakland, California. When changes were made, Kellogg Co.¡¯s Pop-Tarts and PepsiCo¡¯s Funyuns were replaced by reduced-fat chips and granola bars.
¡°Schools that have made these changes have been able to maintain revenue, by alternate methods or by changing out items,¡± said Jessica Donze Black, director of the Washington-based Kids¡¯ Safe and Healthful Foods Project at the Pew Health Group, which advocates policies that reduce consumer risks.
Rebecca Ford, a senior special education teacher at Tooele High School in Tooele, Utah, said she hopes the bake sales her students help prepare each week won¡¯t be considered too frequent to be allowed. Her students have autism, Down syndrome and other disabilities. The money is used for educational trips as well as to help students out, such as buying tennis shoes their parents can¡¯t afford, she said.
¡°It teaches them money skills,¡± Ford said in an interview. ¡°We tried different healthy items, but it wasn¡¯t the same at all. They just sat around and got old. I¡¯m not quite sure what we¡¯ll do.¡±

168,Australia's Exports Narrow to Levels Near 'Banana Republic',"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Australia's export base has narrowed to levels approaching that of a ""banana republic,'' a former government adviser says, raising the specter of the country'sÂ economic nadir almost 30 years ago.
The concentration of shipments abroad is at the highest level in more than 50 years, according toÂ Andrew Charlton, who counselled former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on economic policy. The nation'sÂ budget is ""hostage'' to global iron ore prices, with a $10 drop taking up to A$10 billion from forecast revenue, he said.
The global iron ore price has dropped more than $12 in the past month, further exposing Australia's lack of export alternatives.
""Australian governments have been operating on the assumption that, once the mining boom passed, low interest rates and a falling dollar would be enough to bring the non-resource sectors dancing out of their graves,"" Charlton, now director of consultancy AlphaBeta, said in a research report. ""Unfortunately, no such resurrection is occurring.""Â 
""Australia watched idly as the rust-belt manufacturing suburbs around Sydney and Melbourne were transformed from red-brick factories into red-hot real estate,'' he said. Â ""Even some low-income countries like Nepal, Kenya, and Tanzania have greater export diversity than Australia.''
His analysis again raises the question of whatÂ AustraliaÂ will fall back on as the resources tide recedes. Exports have gone backwards as a proportion of the economy over the last 15 years in almost every non-resources industry, and services are now too small to offset mining.
HisÂ concerns hark back to problems in 1986, when weak international commodity prices led to a collapse in exports, prompting then-Treasurer Paul Keating to warn Australia risked becoming a ""banana republic"" if it failed to change.
""If this government cannot get the adjustment, get manufacturing going again, and keep moderate wage outcomes and a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for,'' Keating said in an interview onÂ radio in 1986, after the nation recorded what was then its biggest current account deficit. ""We will end up being a third-rate economy.''"
169,¡®Bank Town¡¯ Charlotte Wrestles With Pay for Police as Boom Ends,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Charlotte, North Carolina, home of the largest U.S. bank, may have to cut pay for police and firefighters as financial institutions consolidate and property-tax collections dwindle.
Growth in real-estate tax revenue for the city of 757,000 may average 1.5 percent during the next five years, its finance department estimates. That¡¯s half the rate of the past decade.
¡°The numbers just don¡¯t work over the long term,¡± said Cyndee Patterson, an ex-City Council member who chaired a nine-member advisory task force appointed by Mayor Anthony Foxx. Projected expenses of $319.8 million will exceed the $316 million allocated for police and fire protection from taxes and grants in 2013, said investment banker Sam Bowles, a panel member whose father, Erskine, co-chaired President Obama¡¯s deficit-reduction commission.
The pressure to curb public-worker compensation in the headquarters city for Bank of America Corp. reflects the fiscal stress facing U.S. municipalities. Baltimore is cutting pay for its 4,000-employee police department by 2 percent this month, said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman. St. Louis froze salaries last July for 1,900 police department workers, said Erica Van Ross, a spokeswoman.
The recession that began in December 2007 led to Wachovia Corp.¡¯s forced sale to Wells Fargo & Co., causing personal income in the Charlotte area to fall 5.7 percent in 2009, the second-biggest drop among U.S. cities, Wells Fargo Securities said in a December report. Bank of America, the nation¡¯s biggest, moved hundreds of jobs to New York after its January 2009 purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co., Wells Fargo economist Michael Brown said in a telephone interview.
Cheaper Houses
The Charlotte metropolitan area¡¯s jobless rate rose to 10.8 percent in November from 5.1 percent in November 2005, according to U.S. labor statistics. Single-family home resale values in the area declined an average 16 percent by October from their August 2007 peak, according to an S&P/Case-Shiller index.
Meanwhile, in 12 of the past 15 years, Charlotte fire and police officers who hadn¡¯t reached peak salaries received 5 percent increases thanks to a ¡°step adjustment,¡± plus annual ¡°market adjustments¡± averaging 3.2 percent, according to the advisory group¡¯s report. About 36 percent of police officers and 60 percent of fire employees are at the top pay grade and don¡¯t get step increases. State law forbids them to bargain collectively.
Safer Streets
Charlotte police rookies start at $36,503 with top pay of $65,554, while firefighters begin at $34,766 and top out at $56,629, according to data the city provided to the task force in April.
The pay system doesn¡¯t need an overhaul, said Todd Walther, president of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police. ¡°These people put their lives on the line and you¡¯ve got to compensate them fairly,¡± he said.
Police Chief Rodney Monroe, who arrived in 2008 from Richmond, Virginia, has improved security, said Susan Lindsay, a director of Charlotte EAST, a community group promoting the east-side neighborhoods. Violent crime overall declined by 13 percent, and property crime fell 7.3 percent in 2010; homicides increased to 59 from 55, according to police department statistics.
¡°I don¡¯t think they should do anything in reducing pay to police and fire officers,¡± Lindsay said.
Patterson, the former council member, is president of the Lee Institute, a nonprofit leadership development group based in Charlotte.
¡°We have fine police and fire departments, but you can¡¯t continue to maintain these pay levels going forward,¡± she said. ¡°There isn¡¯t a quick way to grow out of this.¡±
Workers Fired
Almost 80 percent of U.S. municipalities cut jobs in the past fiscal year to cope with a 3.2 percent revenue drop, the most in at least 25 years, according to an October report from the National League of Cities in Washington.
In Charlotte, whose general-obligation debt carries a top rating from Moody¡¯s Investors Service, public safety eats 65 percent of general-fund expenses, while property taxes provide 64 percent of revenue, according to the task force report.
Sam Bowles, 37, said that the question of reducing police pay to balance the budget may be as controversial as Social Security cuts proposed by his father¡¯s federal deficit commission. The younger Bowles is a vice president at Carousel Capital, a private equity firm in Charlotte that Erskine Bowles co-founded.
City of Bankers
He is a banker in a city of them. Expansions by Bank of America and First Union Corp., which bought Wachovia in 2001, made Charlotte the second-largest U.S. financial center by assets. Intracity competition between chief executive officers Hugh McColl Jr. and Kenneth D. Lewis Jr. of Bank of America, and Edward Crutchfield and Kennedy Thompson at Wachovia led to the development of a dozen downtown skyscrapers. Bars, restaurants, residential developments and an arena for the Bobcats of the National Basketball Association blossomed around them.
¡°The development boom has completed and the city is seeing declines in real estate values, falling automobile and personal property value and major declines in applications for building permits,¡± according to the task-force report.
Charlotte¡¯s growth before 2008 made for little worry about the annual pay increases, city Budget Director Ruffin Hall told the task force in October, according to meeting minutes. In a survey of 36 other cities, the task force found only Colorado Springs and Milwaukee offered step increases topping 5 percent for both fire and police employees. The average was about 4 percent.
`On Target'
The task force report ¡°is on target,¡± said Foxx. ¡°I¡¯ve asked our staff to convene a working group of managers as well as police and fire officials on how to resolve the issue.¡± Recommendations may be made before the city¡¯s budget is adopted in June, he said.
The city must find a way to nurture its police and firefighters, Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Cannon, a Democrat who oversees council meetings when Foxx is absent, said in a Dec. 22 e-mail.
¡°It could be an option to hire no more public safety employees as we grow as a city,¡± Cannon said. ¡°But then you¡¯ll be calling me about crime being up in area neighborhoods, or with businesses, or houses of worship because of the lack of visibility of the same people you want me to cut.¡±

170,¡®Barbaric¡¯ Soccer Resisted by Prussians; ¡®Pina¡¯ Lives: Film,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Before soccer came to Germany in the late 1800s, ¡°sport¡± meant whiskered, solemn Prussians in voluminous pantaloons performing exercises on vaults, or on rings suspended from the ceiling.
Nineteenth-century gymnastics looks joyless in ¡°Der ganz grosse Traum¡± (The Very Big Dream), an Anglophile, feel-good movie opening in German cinemas today. The film is a fictionalized account of how English soccer was introduced to Germany, where it was at first deemed barbaric. The credits tell us it was banned in Bavarian schools until 1927.
Now it¡¯s the national sport and a Bavarian team, Bayern Munich, is the reigning champion. The man credited with bringing the game to Germany is Konrad Koch, who started playing in 1874 at the Braunschweig gymnasium where he taught ancient languages and German. (He also tried to introduce cricket, but it never caught on.)
The movie takes liberties with his biography. Played by Daniel Bruehl, the talented star of the 2002 comedy ¡°Goodbye Lenin,¡± Koch is the school¡¯s first English teacher, arriving fresh from four years in Oxford. He takes the boys to play soccer in the gym, where they have to speak English. (¡°I keek ze ball into ze goal.¡±)
Pronouncing ¡®th¡¯
When the history teacher encourages the boys to speculate about how many Prussian troops would be needed to conquer the U.K., Koch teaches them to pronounce ¡°th¡± so they don¡¯t ¡°sound like idiots¡± if they visit Britain.
The authorities view him as a threat to their rigid, class-bound, militaristic society and ban soccer from the school premises. Then a delegation from Berlin announces it will visit to examine whether the sport may have pedagogical value.
In this story, soccer overcomes class barriers, teaches fairness and gamesmanship, and encourages individuality instead of blind obedience. First-time director Sebastian Grobler touches on big themes.
There are moments where the plot seems formulaic. Some scenes near the end lurch into un-Prussian schmalziness. One incident of slapstick humor is schoolboyish (a chaplain gets a soccer ball whacked into his sensitive areas).
Yet ¡°Der ganz grosse Traum¡± shines a spotlight on an era that rarely features in German movies. The performances, even by the newcomers playing pupils, are all good. Rating: **1/2
No Gimmick
¡°Pina¡± has convinced me 3-D movies are not just a gimmick. This artistic, beautifully crafted dance documentary by Wim Wenders takes you right into the space inhabited by the dancers.
The movie, which opens in German cinemas today, is a tribute to the choreographer Pina Bausch who died in 2009 of cancer at the age of 68. She founded a genre known as ¡°Tanztheater¡± in which the dancers speak, sing, cry and laugh.
The stage is covered in peat for her primeval ¡°Sacre du Printemps.¡± In ¡°Cafe Mueller,¡± dancers move blindly around a gray area littered with furniture, unable to make contact.
Bausch¡¯s dancers, some of whom are elderly, pay tribute to their mentor in interviews and in movement. The film offers spectacular images of them performing against a background of industrial sites in the Ruhr region.
In one, a woman in a blue dress dances on pointe in the coking plant of a disused mine. In another, a man wearing rabbit ears sits at the back of the suspended monorail in Wuppertal, the city where Bausch¡¯s company is based.
Dance fans will want to see this film. It may even win a few converts to the art. Rating: ***

July 4 (Bloomberg) -- A lengthy public inquiry into the behavior of U.K. banks in the wake of the ¡°Barclays firestorm¡± would pose substantial risk ¡°in this period of systemic fragility,¡± Richard Lambert wrote in the Financial Times.
The banking system is under threat from the crisis in the euro region, from questions over part of the banks¡¯ loan portfolios, especially in commercial real estate, wrote Lambert, the chancellor of the University of Warwick and a former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry.
If controls have to be tighter following the Libor scandal, ¡°so be it: that is the argument for a short, sharp inquiry,¡± wrote Lambert, who was a member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee from 2003 to 2009.

172,¡®Barrage¡¯ Confronts Chipmaker as Quake Creates Go-To Supplier,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 4 (Bloomberg) -- Microchip Technology Inc. Chief Executive Officer Steve Sanghi is fielding a ¡°barrage¡± of requests for replacement parts as the Japanese earthquake disrupts global semiconductor supplies.
Customers should order at least 12 weeks¡¯ worth of their needs for microcontrollers, used in devices from washing machines to coffee makers to car parts, Sanghi wrote in a March 21 letter. Many recent deals have only been for ¡°near-term backlog,¡± he said, without elaborating.
¡°I am expecting a huge surge of redesign inquiries,¡± Sanghi wrote. ¡°Our existing customers should get in line first. We work from backlog, and those who commit backlog to us secure the supply first.¡±
Three weeks after the March 11 disaster idled scores of Japanese factories, U.S. companies are bracing for rising demand for everything from fish meal used in shrimp farming to caustic soda that helps make soap and paper. Shortages may worsen in coming weeks as more manufacturers gauge which parts are unavailable from their suppliers¡¯ suppliers.
¡°It¡¯s a wake-up call for companies about the risk of a global supply chain: ¡®Hello, now we have a huge disruption that¡¯s going to be very costly,¡¯¡± said Clyde Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, which promotes U.S.-based manufacturing. ¡°Business is going to be good for guys who have maintained a presence in the U.S.¡±
Omega, Dow
Omega Protein Corp., Caterpillar Inc., Tyson Foods Inc. and Dow Chemical Co. were among more than 20 companies singled out in interviews last week with analysts, executives and consultants as being among hundreds of U.S. producers that may benefit from shifts in purchasing patterns after the earthquake.
Japan sold $120.3 billion in products to the U.S. in 2010 and bought $60.5 billion worth, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Lost Japanese production creates openings for U.S. companies to substitute their wares or expand existing markets.
While Microchip has had ¡°zero¡± supply-chain disruptions, customers should act because the Chandler, Arizona-based company has ¡°received a barrage of inquiries from customers in need of a quick ¡®replacement¡¯ for several non-Microchip microcontrollers that they had in production,¡± CEO Sanghi wrote.
Asking buyers to order enough microcontrollers to last a quarter would be more than normal, said Chris Caso, a Susquehanna International Group analyst in New York. That much lead time would be typical if supplies get tight, he said.
¡®Have a Look¡¯
¡°If you are a Japanese company that hasn¡¯t used Microchip before, you have an incentive to have a look at them now,¡± said Caso, who recommends buying the shares.
Microchip¡¯s main competitor in Japan is Renesas Electronics Corp., according to Caso. Kanagawa, Japan-based Renesas said March 28 that work resumed at two of five chip plants damaged in the quake. Its Naka factory, which produced about 20 percent of its microcontrollers, was among the hardest hit and remained offline, according to a company statement.
Microchip reported revenue of $947.7 million in the fiscal year that ended in March 2010, with 51 percent of its sales in Asia. It has manufacturing locations in Chandler and Tempe, Arizona; Gresham, Oregon; and Bangkok. Sanghi¡¯s letter resonated with customers, said Eric Lawson, a company spokesman.
¡°We¡¯re seeing a lot of interest,¡± Lawson said, without elaborating. ¡°There have been a substantial amount of inquiries.¡±
Food Chain
Interest in U.S. food exports is rising in Japan on concern that local goods are tainted by radiation, companies and industry groups said. Japan¡¯s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said March 26 that 99 products, including milk and vegetables, were found to be contaminated in Tokyo and five prefectures.
¡°A real question is whether seafood consumption in Japan loses some of its share of stomach to U.S. protein,¡± said Timothy S. Ramey, a Lake Oswego, Oregon-based analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.
Black cod coming into Hallmark Fisheries in Charleston, Oregon, are fetching about $9.30 a pound, $1 more than when the previous season ended in December as Japan confronts a shortage, Production Manager Scott Adams said.
¡°I¡¯m not trying to make money off of someone else¡¯s misfortune, but Japanese love their seafood,¡± Adams said. ¡°They are going to want fish they know is caught from a safe area.¡±
Fish Food
Farm-raised salmon and shrimp in Japan also may be in for a dietary shift: Houston-based Omega may be able to boost shipments of fish meal because of earthquake and tsunami damage to the country¡¯s fishing fleet.
The aquaculture industry, which uses fish meal as feed, will need products harvested from new locations, Omega Chief Financial Officer Bret Scholtes said in an interview. He said fish meal generated 69 percent of the $168 million in 2010 sales for the company, which operates a 49-vessel fleet harvesting menhaden from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.
Tyson, which is based in Springdale, Arkansas, and is the largest U.S. meat processor, saw a short-term boost in Japanese demand and requests to fill orders more quickly for that country after the quake, Chief Operating Officer Jim Lochner said at a March 30 JPMorgan Chase & Co. conference.
Pork Demand
Smithfield Foods Inc., the world¡¯s largest pork processor, recently has seen rising Japanese demand for the more-profitable fresh pork sold to retailers over the frozen meat typically used for ham or sausage, Chief Financial Officer Bo Manly said at the JPMorgan event. Japan accounts for 41 percent of the Smithfield, Virginia-based company¡¯s international shipments, according to its website.
With the Japanese government estimating quake-and-tsunami damage at as much as $309 billion, almost four times as much as the U.S. toll from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the recovery effort also may be an opportunity for manufacturers such as Caterpillar, the world¡¯s largest maker of earthmoving equipment.
As Caterpillar gains, so would suppliers such as Parker Hannifin Corp., said Jeff Windau, an Edward Jones & Co. analyst in St. Louis who recommends buying both companies.
¡°Parker Hannifin makes the hydraulics that raises the bucket in the Caterpillar hauler,¡± Windau said. ¡°They also make hoses, controllers and other parts. So they benefit, too.¡±
Jim Dugan, a spokesman for Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar, said the company had no comment on analysts¡¯ predictions. Christopher Farage, a spokesman for Cleveland-based Parker Hannifin, also declined to comment.
Caustic Soda
With Japanese plants forced to idle 19 percent of their capacity for caustic soda because of the earthquake, U.S. chemical producers such as Dow and Occidental Petroleum Corp. may benefit, said Mark Eramo, executive vice president of consultant Chemical Market Associates Inc. in Houston.
Caustic soda, produced in tandem with chlorine, is used to make pulp, paper and soap. Midland, Michigan-based Dow is the world¡¯s largest maker of chlor-alkali, followed by Occidental, Olin Corp. and PPG Industries Inc. Richard S. Kline, a spokesman for Los Angeles-based Occidental, declined to comment, and Dow¡¯s Greg Baldwin didn¡¯t return calls and e-mails.
Also hampered by the quake are producers of paraxylene, which is used in plastic beverage bottles, with 24 percent of Japan¡¯s capacity offline, Eramo said. The country accounts for almost a quarter of global exports, he said. Plastic beverage bottles are primarily produced outside the U.S.
¡®Not in Japan¡¯
¡°If you are a large producer not in Japan, you¡¯ll benefit from the pricing spike,¡± said Hassan Ahmed, an analyst at Alembic Global Advisors in New York. The biggest U.S. paraxylene producer is Exxon Mobil Corp.
U.S. electronics companies other than Microchip also may be able to take advantage of a Japan-built parts shortage that industry forecaster IHS Automotive says may have contributed to a global production loss of 585,000 cars and trucks in March.
These include Freescale Semiconductor Holdings, the world¡¯s second-largest supplier of microcontrollers after Japan¡¯s quake-disrupted Renesas, said Dale Ford, a senior vice president at industry researcher IHS iSuppli in Santa Clara, California.
¡°We¡¯re continuing to work directly with our customers and assess the situation,¡± said Rob Hatley, a Freescale spokesman, who wouldn¡¯t comment on any possible gain in sales or pricing.
With output slowed at plants operated by Toshiba Corp., the second-biggest maker of flash memory, rising prices would benefit Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology Inc., Ford said.
Flash Memory
Micron expects quake-related supply disruptions, Chairman and CEO Steven R. Appleton told investors on a March 23 call. Any increase in flash-memory demand is probably more than two months away, and it¡¯s also possible that orders will decline, Appleton said.
The benefits to companies that have kept factories in the U.S. may help generate support for President Barack Obama¡¯s efforts to nurture more manufacturing jobs, said Prestowitz, author of ¡°The Betrayal of American Prosperity: Free Market Delusions, America¡¯s Decline, and How We Must Compete in the Post-Dollar Era.¡±
Asia became the center for so much of the world¡¯s manufacturing and development because countries in region such as Japan developed policies to support it, he said.
¡°We haven¡¯t had any real policy,¡± Prestowitz said. ¡°We¡¯ve just been in ¡®let it happen¡¯ mode, and they¡¯ve been in ¡®we¡¯re going to grab it¡¯ mode.¡±

173,"`Barrow Boy' Brokers Were Ignored by Bankers on Libor, Read Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp
A formerÂ ICAP Plc employee accused of helping rig Libor told a London court that interdealer brokers are second-class citizens in the financial world who are ignored by better-educated bankers.
Darrell Read said during his first day of testimony thatÂ brokers didn¡¯t have the status to sway bankers when it came to setting the benchmark rate. Most brokers have fewer math and computer skills and aren¡¯t respected by the bankers who are their clients.
""Banks hold all the power,"" the 50-year-old Read said. ""The old image is of East End barrow boys paid to give prices and be entertaining.""
Read is one of six brokers from ICAP, Tullett Prebon Plc and RP Martin Holdings Ltd. on trial for conspiring to defraud by helping former UBS Group AG trader Tom Hayes rig a version of the London interbank offered rate tied to the yen. Hayes was convicted of similar charges in August and sentenced to 14 years in prison.
The first of the defendants to testify at the seven-week-old trial, Read was taken through a statement he provided to prosecutors at the Serious Fraud Office in 2014 by his attorney.Â He will be cross-examined later in the week.
Prosecutors claim Read helped Hayes by pressuring another defendant who worked at ICAP, Colin Goodman, to skew the daily ""Libor prediction e-mail"" Goodman sent to rate-setting banks to suit Hayes¡¯s positions. The e-mail earned Goodman the nickname ""Lord Libor"" in the industry.
""The idea that a bank would listen to a broker"" is nonsense, Read said.
Wearing a dark suit,Â Read told jurors he only passed on Hayes¡¯s requests for higher and lower Libors to Goodman so that Goodman¡¯s e-mail would be as accurate as possible. Hayes was the biggest player in the market, so his trading positions would likely affect where Libor was set each day. Read never tried to help him manipulate the rate, he said.
Read met Hayes in 2002 when he was a ""painfully shy"" 21-year-old. In the years that followed, he watched Hayes morph into an aggressive trader who routinely lost his temper, he said.
In April 2007, Read moved to New Zealand after Hayes moved to Tokyo so they could operate in a similar time zone. From that point on, Hayes was, for all intents and purposes, Read¡¯s only client, he told jurors. In 2010, Read took home more than 500,000 pounds ($760,000) in bonus and salary.
""My salary was totally dependent on Tom Hayes,"" Read said. ""If he didn¡¯t pay any brokerage I didn¡¯t make any money.""
After 20 years in the market he had planned to retire to New Zealand and become a teacher in 2005, but was repeatedly persuaded by ICAP to stick around. His wife and two sons are still there, he said.
Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal."

Dec. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Actor Christian Bale, who CNN reported jostled with guards when he tried to visit an activist in China, isn¡¯t welcome to ¡°make news¡± in the country, Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said today.
Bale ¡°should be embarrassed¡± Liu said at a daily briefing today, after CNN posted footage last week that it said showed Bale scuffling with plainclothes guards when he tried to visit Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer who is confined to his home in the eastern province of Shandong.
Bale was in China to promote ¡°The Flowers of War,¡± the Chinese-made film in which he stars, when he went to visit Chen, CNN said. The activist was released from prison last year after serving a four year sentence for organizing couples who accused officials of forcing them to have abortions.
¡°I understand that the actor was invited by the director Zhang Yimou to attend the opening ceremony of the film but he was not invited to fabricate news or shoot films in a certain village in Shandong province,¡± Liu said. ¡°The Chinese side will not welcome him to make news in China.¡±
Bale will star in the third film of director Christopher Nolan¡¯s Batman franchise in 2012. He won a best-supporting actor Oscar this year for his role in the film ¡°The Fighter.¡±

175,¡®Battlestar Galactica¡¯ to Boost Genting Singapore¡¯s Profit,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Paul Wilkie was out of breath as he got off the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster at Universal Studios Singapore. ¡°It was unbelievable, I¡¯m still dizzy.¡±
Wilkie, 28, who works at a radio station in Australia, also plans to drop by the casinos run by Genting Singapore Plc and Las Vegas Sands Corp., where he and his friends will bet on poker, blackjack and ¡°really anything and everything.¡±
Genting Singapore, which runs the theme park, reported recurring profit of S$657 million ($514 million) in the first year of its Resorts World Sentosa, and is relying on visitors like Wilkie to boost revenue. Earnings at the world¡¯s third-biggest casino company by market value may surge this year, according analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Singapore¡¯s two casinos are benefiting from the attractions at Resorts World Sentosa¡¯s theme park, said Aaron Fischer, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CLSA Ltd. ¡°The casinos are a major draw card, but Universal Studios is also providing Resorts World and Las Vegas Sands¡¯ Marina Bay with new customers, which provide a more predictable revenue base and generate higher margins.¡±
Component Failure
Tickets to the park were sold out on online yesterday as Universal Studios staged an official reopening of the attraction based on the Battlestar Galactica television series after shutting it down for almost a year to fix a ¡°ride component failure.¡±
Genting Singapore has surged almost fivefold in the past two years in Singapore trading, making it Asia¡¯s second-biggest casino company by market value.
Full-year net income of $37.8 million announced by the casino operator today missed the S$615 million average forecast of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg as financing costs increased and high-stakes gamblers got luckier. Net income will reach S$1.12 billion this year, according to the analysts¡¯ average estimate.
¡°We are not changing our positive view, which is based on the huge free cash flow generated by the property,¡± Fischer said after the earnings announcement. Last year¡¯s profit from continuing operations of S$657 million, compares with a year-ago loss of S$282 million.
Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of S$386 million matched his estimate, Fischer said.
Transformers Ride
The $4.7 billion Resorts World also plans to open a marine museum, a water park and two hotels starting from the middle of the year. Another ride based on the Transformers movies may open by the end of the year, according to the company.
Singapore¡¯s casinos have provided ¡°a new leg of growth for the Singapore economy,¡± said Song Seng-Wun, an economist at CIMB Research Pte. in Singapore. ¡°If the macro environment continues to stay favorable, there¡¯s no reason that the resorts won¡¯t be able to attract a steady stream of visitors.¡±
The city state¡¯s economy grew by a record 14.5 percent last year, helped by the S$420 million in net revenue contributed by Genting Singapore and Las Vegas Sands Corp.
Genting Singapore¡¯s ¡°more holistic approach¡± will help growth in the coming year, said Carey Wong, senior investment analyst at OCBC Investment Research Pte. ¡°Somebody with the excuse to bring their families for an outing to Universal Studios is also more prepared to spend money at the casino.¡±
Cash Flow
Today¡¯s earnings report ¡°threw our numbers a little bit,¡± Wong said. Still, ¡°cash flow wise, they¡¯re pretty good,"" he said, citing Genting Singapore¡¯s S$298.7 million net cash inflow from operating activities in the fourth quarter. For the full year, cash flow was S$1.41 billion.
The reopening of the Battlestar Galactica ride ¡®¡®will allow for a 20 to 25 percent increase in ticket sales,¡± said Fischer, who forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of S$2 billion this year for Genting Singapore.
Some of the visitors to the theme park will visit the casinos, said Huei Suen Ng, who covers gambling companies with Fischer at CLSA. They recommend buying Genting Singapore¡¯s stock.
Vincent Khoo, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Holdings Ltd., predicts a more modest profit of S$886 million, because of the ¡°fairly developed market¡± the company operates in. ¡°I can¡¯t see how the industry can grow leaps and bounds,¡± and the non-casino businesses may contribute less than 10 percent to the company¡¯s growth, he said.
Tourism Revenue
Genting Bhd., owner of a controlling stake in the Resorts World operator, on Feb. 7 fell 3.9 percent to 10.90 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur trading after Citigroup Inc. cut its revenue forecast for the Singapore casino unit.
Still, Singapore aims to attract 17 million visitors and triple annual tourism revenue to S$30 billion by 2015. Tourism revenue in the Southeast Asian economy with the highest gross domestic product per capita rose 49 percent to S$18.8 billion last year.
Las Vegas Sands announced on Feb. 17 it plans to ask Singapore for more land because it¡¯s running out of space at its $6 billion Marina Bay Sands, which houses a sky park and a 160 meter-long swimming pool atop three 55-floor hotel towers, along with its casino, convention facilities, shops and restaurants.
The casino resorts¡¯ ¡°amenities will result in attracting higher volumes of mass-market tourism traffic,¡± said Jonathan Galaviz, who analyzes tourism and the gambling industry as managing director of Galaviz & Co. ¡°Multibillion dollar integrated resorts need thousands of people providing foot traffic everyday. Having only a few hundred millionaires roaming around won¡¯t cut it in the long-run.¡±
Out of Singapore¡¯s 11.6 million visitors last year, 4.8 million, or 41 percent, were from Southeast Asia, according to government figures. Chinese tourists came in second at 1.2 million, or 10 percent.
Hentje Pongoh, a coal trader from Indonesia, spent a whole day at Universal Studios Singapore, drawn by rides such as the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster. While he ran out of time to gamble, the 39-year-old said he will return ¡°maybe next month¡± to visit Resorts World Sentosa¡¯s casino.

176,¡¯Bear Flag¡¯ Signals Oil Drop to Near $60: Technical Analysis,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil is set for a drop to near $60 a barrel, extending a descent started in May, according to a technical analysis by independent analyst Jim Stellakis.
¡°Last month¡¯s breakdown in crude oil is continuing the longer-term bearish pattern which was started by the May decline,¡± Stellakis said. The bear flag pattern is signaled after a break occurs below a rising trading range.
Crude oil for October delivery fell as much as 1.1 percent before gaining $1.08 to settle at $74.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices for October dropped 9.4 percent in August, pushing futures below the support level. The contract lost $14.05, or 15 percent, in May.
The price target, expected over the next couple of months, was derived by taking the length of the initial decline in May and projecting it lower from the support level, Stellakis said.
¡°Across commodities, energy has the weakest technical profile,¡± he said. ¡°The continued weak price action indicates supply is still greater than demand.¡±

Sept. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Raghvendra Kedia, vice-president of sales at Systematix Shares and Securities Ltd., comments on the outlook for Indian stocks. Kedia spoke on phone from Mumbai.
On Swiss Franc exchange-rate cap:
¡°For India there is no impact in the development because Indian companies do not have much exposure to the Swiss Franc. Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services do have exposure, but this will be insignificant to the broader revenue stream.¡±
On markets:
¡°There is a Reserve Bank of India policy meet on Sept. 16, so markets are very apprehensive right now, especially on banking and interest-rate-sensitive stocks. Investors are waiting for the verdict of the policy meet before taking positions. U.S. economic data has not been impressive. Investors are waiting for Obama¡¯s speech to find out how the U.S. will phase out of slowing growth and whether there will be QE3.¡±
On investments:
¡°Investors should refrain from buying till some certainty emerges in markets. Let some cues come from the U.S. markets and wait for the Reserve Bank of India¡¯s policy meet. It might bring better levels to enter markets. In this policy meet, the way the 10-year paper is behaving, it doesn¡¯t look like there would be a policy rate hike.
¡°Investors should look at banking stocks, as this sector has been beaten down massively in the last six weeks, so we would expect a trading bounce. Investors should avoid metals and oil; metals because they are prone to volatility in the European markets.¡±
On interest rates:
¡°There should be no change in rates. Since March 2010 there have already been 11 hikes in less than 18 months. The Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has also said the Reserve Bank of India will not go so aggressive on policy tightening. So in the backdrop of the statement and the hikes, this is the peak of the interest-rate cycle. There may be a U-turn in early 2012.¡±

March 8 (Bloomberg) -- The past two years have shown that stock investors need to focus on ¡°the beaten-up areas of the market¡± when prices rebound, according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup Inc.¡¯s chief U.S. equity strategist.
The CHART OF THE DAY compares the Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index¡¯s advance since March 9, 2009, when the benchmark reached a 12-year low, with the period¡¯s best and worst performers among 24 industry groups in the index.
Auto-related stocks set the S&P 500¡¯s pace, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as the industry-group index more than quintupled in the period through yesterday. Grocery and drugstore stocks had the smallest overall gain, at 34 percent.
¡°Fears of a Great Depression reenactment provided investors with a powerful trading opportunity over the past two years,¡± Levkovich wrote today in a report. The auto industry is among those most closely linked to the economy¡¯s performance, while food and drug retailers had less to gain from economic growth.
The two industries¡¯ rankings were almost exactly the opposite in the preceding bear market, which lasted 17 months. The S&P 500 Automobiles and Components Index tumbled 84 percent, more than any other industry except banks. The S&P 500 Food and Staples Retailing Index did best by losing only 26 percent.

180,`Beau¡¯ Taylor¡¯s Commodity Hedge Fund Said to Top $500 Million,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 14 (Bloomberg) -- The Taylor Woods Master Fund Ltd., a commodity hedge fund provided with about $150 million in startup capital by Blackstone Group LP last year, has grown to more than $500 million, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Taylor Woods is aiming to expand assets to at least $1 billion, said the person, who declined to be identified as the information isn¡¯t public and didn¡¯t give a timeframe for the planned increase. The fund, which began trading in February, returned 3.22 percent in its first four months, according to a report to investors obtained by Bloomberg News.
Hedge funds attracted $4.7 billion in May, taking in $100 billion during the first five months, the largest amount since at least 2005, according to Singapore-based Eurekahedge Pte. Last month, the Standard & Poor¡¯s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials slumped 6.8 percent, the biggest monthly loss in a year, amid concerns that the global recovery may be faltering.
¡°We remain constructive on the commodity complex,¡± Chief Investment Officer George ¡®Beau¡¯ Taylor, 40, wrote in the report. Taylor, former head of global commodity proprietary trading at Credit Suisse AG, co-founded the fund with Trevor Woods, who used to head global energy proprietary trading at Credit Suisse. Woods is president of the firm, which is based in Greenwich, Connecticut.
¡®Attractive Levels¡¯
¡°The pullback from May highs has provided an opportunity to enter the market at attractive levels,¡± Taylor wrote. The fund ended last month with bullish bets equal to 79 percent of assets compared with 75 percent at the end of April, he said.
Money managers investing in commodities lost an average of 3 percent last month and 0.1 percent from February to May, according to the Eurekahedge CTA/Managed Futures Hedge Fund Index on Bloomberg. The Taylor Woods fund returned 0.71 percent in May, the report said.
The fund used options to protect its so-called long positions in energy futures in May, when it had 65 percent of its holdings in fuels as of May 31, the report said. Long positions are bets that prices will increase.
The fund derived a gain of 0.6 percent from energy investments last month, according to the report. Brent crude dropped 7.3 percent in May, the worst decline in a year.
¡°Gains in oil, U.S. power and U.S. natural gas were somewhat offset by losses in coal,¡± Taylor said in the report, referring to May¡¯s performance.
Blackstone Group, the world¡¯s largest private-equity firm, provided about $150 million in initial capital to the fund, two people with knowledge of the plan said in September.
Taylor started his career as an energy trader at Merrill Lynch & Co. in 1994, and later ran Credit Suisse¡¯s global commodities team with Adam Knight. Woods began at Enron Corp. in 1997. Both crossed paths first at Morgan Stanley, then JPMorgan Chase & Co., before joining Credit Suisse in 2007.

181,N.Z. Inflation Accelerates Less Than Economists Expected,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 18 (Bloomberg) -- New Zealand¡¯s inflation accelerated less than economists estimated, backing up Finance Minister Bill English¡¯s view that price gains aren¡¯t a problem and giving the central bank room to keep interest rates low. The kiwi fell.
Consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months, when they advanced 2.3 percent, Statistics New Zealand said in Wellington today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists was for a 1 percent gain.
Economic growth of less than 1 percent in the fourth quarter and slower-than-expected inflation add to the case for central bank Governor Alan Bollard to keep rates at a record-low 2.5 percent for much of 2011 to buoy confidence after earthquakes in Christchurch hurt spending. New Zealand¡¯s stance contrasts with those in China, India and Singapore, where central banks are tightening policy amid growing price pressures.
¡°Underlying inflation remains benign¡± in New Zealand, said Helen Kevans, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney. ¡°There remains little urgency for Governor Bollard to tighten policy.¡±
New Zealand¡¯s dollar and bond yields fell after the report. The currency bought 79.38 U.S. cents at 5 p.m. in Wellington after reaching a three-year high of 80.05 cents before today¡¯s data. Three-year bond yields fell 6 basis points to 3.51 percent.
Inflation Target
Bollard, who is required to keep annual inflation between 1 percent and 3 percent, said on April 11 he will focus monetary policy on medium-term inflation pressures rather than any immediate jump in costs arising from record-high prices for milk and meat in world markets.
Prices excluding food, fuel and electricity rose 0.1 percent in the quarter, the statistics agency said today.
English said in a Bloomberg Television interview last week he isn¡¯t concerned about inflation, which has been exacerbated by a higher sales-tax and other one-time events. An Oct. 1 increase in sales tax to 15 percent from 12.5 percent and a boost in levies on tobacco and cigarettes has contributed to consumer-price gains.
¡°With good central bank focus on an inflation target, we don¡¯t see any reason to believe that inflation is going to be a problem for us over the next few years,¡± English said in the interview on April 15 at the Boao Forum for Asia in southern China¡¯s Hainan province. ¡°There will be some pressures there as the economy picks up, but we¡¯re in pretty good shape on inflation.¡±
Christchurch Quake
Annual inflation accelerated to 4.5 percent in the year ended March 31 and Bollard has forecast price gains may reach 5.4 percent in the period to June 30 before falling below 3 percent by the end of 2011.
Bollard cut the official cash rate on March 10 to boost confidence after an earthquake in the southern city of Christchurch on Feb. 22 killed more than 170 people, wrecked houses and forced companies out of the central business district. The central bank slashed its 2011 growth forecast to 1.3 percent from 2.7 percent.
Ten of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News last month predicted Bollard will leave the official cash rate at 2.5 percent until the first quarter of 2012. Four estimated a rate increase in the fourth quarter.
Elsewhere, Asian central banks are tightening policy as rising commodity prices fan inflation. China yesterday increased banks¡¯ reserve requirements and central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said monetary tightening will continue for ¡°some time.¡±
In India, inflation accelerated more than economists estimated in March as the cost of fuel and manufactured goods rose, putting pressure on policy makers to raise rates in Asia¡¯s third-largest economy. Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand also increased borrowing costs this year to contain prices, and Singapore said last week it would allow further currency gains.

182,¡®Berkeley Mafia¡¯ Now Has $514 Billion at Stake: William Pesek,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 8 (Bloomberg) -- It¡¯s quite troubling that Sri Mulyani Indrawati has been roped into a corruption scandal.
Indonesia¡¯s finance minister isn¡¯t necessarily shady. If she were, my confidence in Southeast Asia¡¯s biggest economy would be shaken. Many are wisely giving Sri Mulyani the benefit of the doubt after parliament voted for a criminal probe of a bank bailout that she helped engineer.
This is probably dodgy politics aimed at robbing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of his most competent staffers, including Vice President Boediono. What is clear is that politics have taken an erratic turn that will distract policy makers from the economy and that¡¯s bad news for investors. Those looking to score political points are missing the big picture: Indonesia¡¯s $514 billion economy hangs in the balance.
There is much riding on how Yudhoyono handles a crisis that threatens one of the world¡¯s most promising nations. Handle it well, and investors¡¯ esteem for Indonesia will increase. Bungle the crisis and skepticism will grow. The common view that Indonesia is an obvious buy must now be in question.
Indonesia¡¯s economy is famously corrupt. Transparency International ranks it behind Egypt, Djibouti and Algeria in its latest Corruption Perceptions Index. It¡¯s moving in the right direction, though, and investors are noticing. The Jakarta Composite Index surged 87 percent in 2009. The rupiah gained 16 percent against the dollar.
Sri Mulyani deserves considerable credit for the macroeconomic stability that is impressing markets. A decade ago, the economy was dusting itself off from the Asian crisis and 32 years of corrupt leadership under dictator Suharto. Back then, Indonesia risked going the way of the Soviet Union. Today, it¡¯s among the most stable economies in Asia.
¡®Berkeley Mafia¡¯
The ¡°Berkeley Mafia¡± is having the last laugh. That¡¯s the colorful band of economists sent to study at the California university in the mid-1960s. They returned home championing low inflation, balanced budgets and deregulation.
They had much to do. The economy Suharto inherited was a mess, with four-digit inflation and a mountain of debt. His predecessor, Sukarno, spent 20 years lavishing money on expensive monuments, nationalizing industry and funding budget deficits with excessive borrowings from abroad.
The Berkeley Mafia helped turn things around. Growth averaged 6.5 percent a year from 1965 to 1997, when Southeast Asia crashed. Over time, though, Suharto did his part to foul things up anew.
Suharto¡¯s rule was dominated by family, friends and a military of unchecked influence. In 2007, a few months before Suharto¡¯s death, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime alleged he stole as much as $35 billion, 1.3 percent a year on average of gross domestic product. Suharto¡¯s lawyer dismissed the claim as fiction.
Suharto Inc.
Indonesia is still trying to dismantle Suharto Inc. Many of the policies Yudhoyono has used since 2004 to do that are Berkeley Mafia-esque. That success helps explain why the president is standing by his finance minister and not showing her the door. At least not yet.
Sri Mulyani is part of the new, improved Indonesian mystique. Asia¡¯s most high-profile female economic official is also one of the most respected. Sri Mulyani has been a competent, calming presence, one of the adults in the room as her young democracy prepares itself to join the ranks of the ¡°BRIC¡± economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and China.
When Sri Mulyani travels to Davos, Switzerland, for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum or visits Tokyo, New York and London, people listen. When she explains what¡¯s afoot in Jakarta in her matter-of-fact way, she instills trust and reflects well on her boss, Yudhoyono.
Dangerous Game
So, if you are an ambitious politician who wants to wound the president, who better to go after than his star finance minister? Let¡¯s go one better and go after Yudhoyono¡¯s right hand, Boediono. What makes sense politically is a dangerous game to play with the nation¡¯s 235 million people.
The investigation that parliament approved involves the 6.7 trillion rupiah ($721 million) rescue of PT Bank Century in 2008. While everyone agrees there were abuses during the process, lawmakers are split on whether Boediono, who was central-bank governor at the time, and Sri Mulyani should be legally responsible.
Boediono and Sri Mulyani argue that the bailout helped the country weather the global credit crisis. It occurred amid the market chaos that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Just as many Americans cringed at their government propping up Wall Street, many Indonesians looked askance at saving PT Bank Century.
Systemic Failure
Here is how Yudhoyono put it in a March 4 speech: ¡°Why should we save a bank that has been clumsily managed and led by people who ran away with their customers¡¯ money? No matter how disturbed we were with that, the government had to rescue the Indonesian economy from a systemic failure.¡±
Legitimate questions should be raised, yet it¡¯s hard not to conclude the campaign against Sri Mulyani is personal. Some well-heeled politicians saw their net worth dwindle when Sri Mulyani opposed closing the bourse as shares plunged in 2008.
Corruption and bad infrastructure slow the process of spreading the benefits of growth and reducing poverty. Risks of terrorism in the nation with the largest Muslim population make it harder to attract the investment needed to maintain last year¡¯s 4.5 percent growth rate.
This is as big a test as Yudhoyono will ever face.

183,¡®Best Job in the World¡¯ Ads May Escalate French Strike,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Striking port workers in Marseille don¡¯t know how good they have it, a French business lobby says.
In full-page advertisements today in Le Point magazine and in Les Echos newspaper earlier this week, the lobby lists why operating a crane at the industrial port of Marseille is the ¡°Best Job in the World.¡± An 18-hour workweek, eight weeks of vacation a year, a gross monthly salary of 4,000 euros ($5,581) and guaranteed lifetime employment, it says.
The ad shows a white sandy beach with two cranes looming behind lush vegetation, in a tongue-in-cheek play on a 2009 tourism campaign called the ¡°Best Job In the World¡± by the Australian state of Queensland seeking a caretaker for a tropical island on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef.
¡°A great plan,¡± the ad says ¡°Become a crane operator.¡±
Contesting the ads, the main port union yesterday plastered the walls of the lobby¡¯s office with 250 payslips showing workers make less. The moves show a hardening of stances in the 18-day strike that has paralyzed oil terminals at Fos and Lavera. The work stoppage has left more than 50 fuel tankers unable to unload cargo, cutting crude supplies to refineries and raising the specter of fuel shortages in France.
The strike led by the CGT union may end up costing refiners more than 30 million euros, and other industries and businesses even more. It has cost the French chemicals industry 550 million euros in lost revenue because bulk chemicals carriers aren¡¯t able to dock, according to the Union des Industries Chimiques.
¡®We¡¯re Dying¡¯
¡°Locally, people are scared of criticizing the CGT so we decided that the only way to get our plight publicized is through the national press,¡± said Nicolas Barthe, secretary general of the lobby Union pour les Entreprises des Bouches du Rhone, which represents 10,000 mostly small businesses in the area. ¡°We are calling for government intervention to end this strike because we are dying.¡±
The CGT union says the ads are false and misleading. Port workers make up to 2,000 euros a month and work 35 hours a week, it says. CGT representative Pascal Galeote, who is leading the oil terminals strike, couldn¡¯t be reached for comment. He has said that talks with management at the port haven¡¯t made sufficient progress to end the strike.
The ads are ¡°added provocation,¡± said Bernard Vivier, director of Paris-based researcher Superior Institute of Labor. ¡°Local businesses are seeing clients fleeing and the port sinking. The government may have to get involved.¡±
Wider Strike
The war of words is escalating an already tense situation. Yesterday, the Socialist mayor of Marseille¡¯s first district called on the workers to end the strike.
¡°The strike by a few dozen port employees is causing a serious problem for Marseille,¡± Patrick Mennucci said. Strikers are ¡°hurting the local economy already in difficulty.¡±
The strike to counter government efforts to make French ports more efficient and a broader nationwide protest against President Nicolas Sarkozy¡¯s plan to increase the retirement age to 62 years from 60 years have disrupted transport, schools, power plants and businesses, and are threatening to cause lines at gas stations.
Total SA, Europe¡¯s biggest refiner, is halting operations at its French plants following the strike, increasing the likelihood of fuel shortages.
With the ports strike, exports are being diverted through Barcelona, Genoa and the North Sea at extra cost.
Letterhead
The strike by Fos and Lavera oil terminal workers as well as cutbacks on shift work led by the CGT for all cargo is related to a 2008 law that was aimed at making French harbors more competitive. Under the plan, workers operating equipment such as cranes were to be moved from state-owned ports to privately run cargo handling companies in a bid to make shifts more flexible and work more efficient.
The oil terminals at Marseille were effectively exempted from the changes on the grounds that they are of ¡°national interest¡± and workers will remain employees of a planned unit that will be 60 percent state-owned.
Under the plan, 220 oil terminal workers will be transferred from the Marseille port authority to the unit, to be called Fluxel. They will keep all of their benefits until retirement and can come back to the port if the unit runs into financial difficulty, according to an Oct. 1 port statement.
¡°All guarantees have been given¡± for an end to the strike, Marseille port director Jean-Claude Terrier said Oct. 4 following talks with the union to end the conflict.
¡®Taken Hostage¡¯
In its latest demands, the CGT wants payslips of workers at to the new entity to be on the port authority¡¯s letterhead, while questioning the logic the change, the port authority said.
Claire Battedou, spokeswoman for the port, declined to comment on the accuracy of the business lobby¡¯s advertisement about working conditions of crane operators at the port.
The French port of Marseille has a long history of labor strife. The CGT shut down ports for 170 days to protest against a 1992 law that moved dockworkers to non-state companies. More recently, a strike at the oil terminals in March 2007 lasted 17 days and a 12-day strike in December 2008 cost refineries 26 million euros, according to industry group UFIP.
¡°The port is being taken hostage,¡± French Junior Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau said on LCI TV today. ¡°They are killing the port.¡±

184,¡®Best¡¯ Chart Tracks Curve Before Fed Boosts: Technical Analysis,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 27 (Bloomberg) -- The yield advantage of five-year Treasury notes over two-year debt will increase to as much as 161 basis points before narrowing if history is any guide, according to Citigroup Inc., citing technical indicators.
¡°Between September and October 1993, the full-blown bear market in fixed income began that saw yields move higher throughout 1994,¡± analysts led by Tom Fitzpatrick, New York-based global head of currency strategy at Citigroup, wrote today in a research report. ¡°A similar dynamic today would suggest yields higher in the near term but then possibly lower again before a re-emergence of the up move later this year -- into 2011.¡±
The extra yield investors demand to hold the longer-term notes increased today to 131 basis points, from 121 basis points yesterday, the lowest level since May 2009. The chart is ¡°the best interest-rate chart in the world¡± and ¡°amazingly consistent,¡± the Citigroup strategists wrote.
The Federal Reserve will consider increasing its target lending rate from a record low 0.25 percent when the two-year note yield is closer to its peak reached in June 2009, housing starts are as high as 800,000 and unemployment dips below 9 percent, according to Citigroup, one of the 18 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. That may not happen until the second quarter of next year, the strategists wrote.
¡°Given the belief that they will completely err on the side of caution, even this timeframe could be optimistic,¡± according to the analysts.
Economists forecast unemployment to remain at or above 9 percent through most of 2011, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Housing starts rose in April to a 672,000 annual rate, the highest level since October 2008.
The two-year note yield increased today to 0.87 percent, while the five-year note yield rose to 2.18 percent. The two-year note yield advanced in June 2009 to 1.43 percent, the highest level since November 2008.
In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security, commodity, currency or index.

185,¡®Bible¡¯ Miniseries Draws 13.1 Million Viewers on History,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 5 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°The Bible,¡± the History channel miniseries by ¡°Survivor¡± creator Mark Burnett, drew the network¡¯s biggest audience of the year in its premiere after a months-long campaign to promote the show to Christian audiences.
The first of five two-hour episodes drew 13.1 million viewers, New York-based History said yesterday in a statement. Last year¡¯s premiere of ¡°Hatfields & McCoys,¡± with 13.9 million, was the network¡¯s most-watched program ever. History is part of A&E Television Networks LLC, owned jointly by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp.
Burnett, an avowed Christian, and his wife, ¡°Touched by an Angel¡± star Roma Downey, shot the series over six months in Morocco and enlisted pastors Rick Warren and Joel Osteen, and Cardinal Donald Wuerl, Archbishop of Washington, to connect with Christian audiences. The, strategy pioneered by Mel Gibson with his theatrical film ¡°The Passion of the Christ,¡± culminated with a presentation to 500 clergy on March 2.
¡°We believe our Bible series has the potential to reach not only those who already go to church but could reach a whole new generation of people who have never been to church,¡± Burnett said in a video posted on Google Inc.¡¯s YouTube. ¡°People that may never have read the Bible will get to see those Bible stories in this series.¡±
To promote the series, Burnett reached out to Protestant and Roman Catholic church leaders, touting the project as a teaching aid for use in sermons and weekly study groups. Gibson¡¯s ¡°The Passion of the Christ¡± cost $30 million and generated $612 million in worldwide ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo.
Small Budgets
Smaller faith-affirming films, such as ¡°Fireproof¡± have also successfully based marketing on outreach to churches, said Ted Baehr, chairman of the Christian Film & Television Commission, a group that advises studios.
¡°Fireproof¡± was made for $500,000 and had sales of $33.5 million. Religious audiences trust a minister¡¯s recommendation more than studio ads or reviews by mainstream critics, he said.
¡°The market exists. You¡¯ve just got to reach them through the venues that they are using,¡± Baehr said. ¡°You have to get to what they watch and where they go.¡±
At the March 2 meeting, Warren, head of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, told the audience of about 500 he would shape his next five Sunday sermons around the series. He urged clergy, including others watching a webcast of the event, to do the same.
¡°Don¡¯t miss this opportunity,¡± Warren said. ¡°This is a wave. Part of leadership is catching the wave. God is about to do something really great.¡±
Easter Sunday
Episodes will air every week on History, culminating March 31, Easter Sunday. Lifetime, another A&E Television Networks channel, will air repeats of episodes.
The series was made for about $22 million, said Burnett, who also produces reality shows including ¡°The Apprentice¡± and ¡°The Voice¡± on Comcast Corp.¡¯s NBC and ¡°Shark Tank¡± on Disney¡¯s ABC. Burnett said in the video his success paved the way for him to produce the series and recruit History as a distribution partner.
¡°All of these No. 1 shows, five shows right now, that allowed us to go into the powers within Hollywood to say we wanted to make a faithful Bible miniseries,¡± Burnett said on a Feb. 12 webcast for pastors. ¡°It takes a level of that success within the television business and film to have people pay attention and give you a chance.¡±
¡®Exciting Footage¡¯
¡°We¡¯ve told the stories of the Bible in a way to grab viewers¡¯ attention and draw them in to want to know more,¡± Downey said in the video. ¡°The footage is exciting, it¡¯s compelling, poignant and powerful. Our hope is this series will reach millions of people around the world.¡±
The couple hired Portuguese TV star Diogo Morgado as Jesus, and used special effects firms that work on Hollywood films. In addition to producing and directing, Downey also stars as Mother Mary.
The series will also be shown outside the U.S., and DVDs be on sale in April, according to History. The scripts will bound together into a book and a portion will be edited into a theatrically released film. Burnett and Downey also plan to make the series available for religious education programs.
Disney, based in Burbank, California, gained 0.9 percent to $55.80 yesterday in New York. The stock has climbed 12 percent this year. Closely held Hearst is based in New York and is also a 20 percent partner in Disney¡¯s ESPN.

186,¡®Biblical Exodus¡¯ From Africa Feeds Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
March 17 (Bloomberg) -- As boats carrying hundreds of Africans set sail for a better life in Europe, they were met on Italy¡¯s Lampedusa island with two words by a 5-foot, 8-inch blonde: go away.
¡°They cannot be allowed on the shore,¡± Marine Le Pen, the 42-year-old leader of France¡¯s anti-immigration National Front, said in a March 15 interview in Rome after a three-hour visit the previous day to Lampedusa. ¡°Send boats out to feed them. But they must not set foot on land.¡±
The island, a speck in the Mediterranean Sea closer to Tunisia than Sicily, is experiencing first-hand an immigration surge poised to spread to the rest of Europe and drive a deeper wedge in a north-south divide already tested by the sovereign-debt crisis.
¡°It¡¯s evident that Italy has been abandoned by Europe,¡± Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said in Brussels on March 10 after a meeting with his European Union counterparts. ¡°We can¡¯t be the policeman of Europe.¡±
The month-long civil war in Libya between Muammar Qaddafi¡¯s regime and rebel forces in the oil-rich east has left 6,000 people dead, driven crude prices to a 2 1/2-year high and unleashed what Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, the country¡¯s most popular politician, called a ¡°biblical exodus.¡±
North of Rome, a backlash has already begun as Italy warns its neighbors that 70 percent of Africans washing up on its shores are headed to France and Germany to seek work.
Back on Boats
One solution proposed by Chantal Brunel, a lawyer of French President Nicolas Sarkozy¡¯s Union for a Popular Movement, was to ¡°put them back on their boats.¡± While she apologized for her March 8 remarks, her stance reflects the will of governments outside the Mediterranean rim to keep refugees at bay.
¡°We are ready to help in economic terms, but I don¡¯t see the future in having us expand legal immigration,¡± German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Brussels on March 15.
For Italy, the financial toll comes after the Europe¡¯s fourth-biggest economy promised 11.6 billion euros ($16 billion) in spending cuts to trim its deficit with EU limits. Italy¡¯s EU partners have ignored a request for 100 million euros to help Silvio Berlusconi¡¯s government with the crisis.
Since Jan. 15, more than 9,000 people -- twice the number in 2010 -- have crossed 110 kilometers (70 miles) in boats from Tunisia to Lampedusa, inhabited by less than 6,000 people, the Italian Interior Ministry said.
Italy and Malta face the prospect of an influx of Libyans after severing ties with the former colony.
¡®Become Black¡¯
Last December, Qaddafi warned EU leaders that their region may ¡°become black because millions want to come to Europe.¡±
As part of a reparation deal with Italy worth $5 billion, Qaddafi agreed in 2008 to tighten border controls. That led to the number of Libyan migrants to Italy falling to fewer than 3,000 in 2010 from a record 37,000 two years earlier. In Malta, the influx dropped from a 2008 high of 84 boats bringing 2,775 people to 2 boats carrying 47 in 2010.
Since mid-February, almost 225,000 people have fled Libya, with about 115,000 going to Tunisia and 102,000 to Egypt, the Geneva-based United Nations High Commission for Refugees said on March 10. About 2,000 went to Niger and 5,500 to Algeria.
The distance between Valletta and Tripoli, 220 miles, is the same as that of Paris and London. That makes Malta, which joined the euro region in 2008, an entry point for those escaping the unrest in Libya.
Malta
While arrivals to Lampedusa are shipped to the Italian mainland, immigrants arriving in Malta are held in detention centers for as long as 18 months. More than half of Malta¡¯s 2.5 million-euro military budget goes to food and shelter for the refugees.
Since the turmoil in Libya began on Feb. 15, Malta has received about 26,000 people evacuated by ship from the North African country by their governments and repatriated to their countries of origins.
More than 3,000 kilometers away, on the 22nd floor of a Warsaw skyscraper is Frontex, the EU agency charged with border security. It has no ships or helicopters of its own, nor any autonomous decision-making power. Contributions are entirely voluntary, meaning those most affected by immigration flows bear the brunt of the costs.
On Feb. 20, Frontex launched operation Hermes, named after the winged Greek god, to assist the authorities in Lampedusa. Italy is providing the most equipment: two patrol boats and a plane.
¡°Frontex does not replace the border-control activities of members states as these are performed by, and remain the primary responsibility of the latter,¡± said Frontex spokesman Michal Parzyszek.
No Problem in Finland
Founded in 2005 with a staff of 300, Frontex is run by a Finn, Ilkka Laitinen. The agency¡¯s ability to act quickly in emergencies is hobbled by having to negotiate with 27 governments that grow increasingly impervious to immigration concerns the further north they are located.
¡°Italy and Malta have taken a hit recently, but we haven¡¯t seen massive flows yet,¡± Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said on March 10.
Interior ministers from six EU countries near the Mediterranean Sea called on member states last month to back the creation of a special fund that will help them cope with an ¡°uncontrolled¡± influx of immigration from Libya. Their appeal has gone nowhere.
Holiday Island
In the summer, Lampedusa is brimming with tourists while simultaneously coping with a wave of immigration that occurs in the hottest months, when it¡¯s safer to travel. Many of the island¡¯s inhabitants move to Sicily in the winter, leaving Lampedusa virtually deserted.
January¡¯s first wave of immigrants to Lampedusa was put up in local hotels before the island¡¯s own detention center was forced to re-open after two years. The facility, which is meant to house a maximum of 100 people, often detained four times as many immigrants and was shut due to health and hygiene concerns.
For a half-dozen new arrivals, there was a silver lining to getting to a holiday island out of season, according to Bernardino de Rubeis, Lampedusa¡¯s mayor. He said six Tunisians last month broke into the villa of Italian pop star Claudio Baglioni, where they crashed for the night, drank wine and ate foie gras before leaving at dawn.

187,"'Big Bang' Isn't Porn, So Why Is China Censoring Hollywood?","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Trying to glean what's behind the actions of China's Internet censors can be a bit like reading tarot cards. When it comes to porn, pictures of Tiananmen Square, or any mention of ""free"" and ""Tibet"" in the same sentence, it's obvious why that content gets stomped out. But there are plenty of cases when it makes no sense.
For example, China banned four mainstream American television shows last month that could hardly be considered offensive. (An example punchline from ""The Big Bang Theory,"" one of the shows on China's naughty list: ""I'm not insane. My mother had me tested!"") That move stirred fears in Hollywood and on Wall Street that a wholesale crackdown on American entertainment would be next. The news sent shares of Sohu.com, the Netflix of China, plunging to a one-year low.
Hollywood wouldn't be the first foreign industry to get bounced out of China. Silicon Valley's largest websites are blocked by the government, and citing fears about how they might affect youth, video-game consoles had been illegal in the country for 14 years until the ban was lifted in January. Bloomberg.com has been blocked in China for nearly two years.
Charles Zhang, Sohu's chief executive officer, quickly addressed the issue on the company's earnings call, describing it as a ""standalone event."" He echoed that view last week in an interview on Bloomberg TV. He declined to say why the shows were taken down, although he said rumors that state broadcaster China Central Television pressured the government to take it offline to minimize competition for its airings of ""Big Bang"" were false.
Executives within China's Internet industry agree with Zhang that this isn't the start of something bigger. ""Now and then, you will see that from China,"" Jenny Lee, a Shanghai-based partner at technology investment firm GGV Capital, said in an interview last week.
¡°Occasionally, they want to flex their muscles,"" Lee said. ""But in general, the attitude is open because if it's a true shutdown, it would be shut. It wouldn't just be one or two episodes.""
Blowback from a state-wide ban would be fierce. China has fallen in love with Hollywood. The country has quickly become the second-biggest movie market and is expected to overtake the U.S. by the end of the decade. Youku Tudou, a Beijing-based video website similar to YouTube, has cozied up to the U.S. studios. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson appeared at a shopping mall in Beijing last month as part of a Walt Disney-Youku promotion for ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier.""
In addition to ""Captain America"" clips, Youku's site carried ""The Good Wife"" until last month's incident. Youku CEO Victor Koo described the ban as ""an isolated incident.""
""We've been working with the studios for a long time,"" Koo said in an interview last week. ¡°We¡¯re promoting '24' as we speak. We actually have all the rights for the previous seasons.""
Three of the shows ? ""Big Bang,"" ""The Good Wife"" and ""NCIS"" ? were from CBS, which suggests that the network may have been the target. A CBS spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. The fourth was ""The Practice,"" a decade-old ABC courtroom drama that's probably not in every user's watch queue anyway. The government told Sohu it's reviewing the ban and expects to allow the shows back on the Web, Zhang said on ""Bloomberg West.""
""Now, I think after this incident, they are more careful, and they are more sophisticated,"" Zhang said. ""We are enjoying a real spring of American TV dramas in China."""
188,"Obama, Republicans Focus on Narrower Deal as Deadline Nears","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 28 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama and Republicans are narrowing the debate on a deficit-cutting plan to a reduction of $1 trillion to $2 trillion, though whether that would settle the issue through the 2012 presidential election remains in doubt, according to budget and debt experts.
White House press secretary Jay Carney said today that Obama will continue the deficit talks with Senate Democratic leaders tomorrow at the White House. Carney declined to say whether the president has scheduled any more meetings with Republicans following his discussion yesterday with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
¡°We continue to consult with congressional leaders,¡± he told reporters aboard Air Force One accompanying the president to Iowa.
Carney repeated that Obama believes a ¡°significant¡± deal is possible even as Republicans and Democrats show little signs of compromise on entitlements and taxes. Republicans are holding firm in their demand for spending cuts in excess of what is needed to raise the government¡¯s credit limit.
The clock is ticking closer to Aug. 2 -- the date when, the Treasury Department estimates, the U.S. risks a default on its debt obligations unless Congress increases the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.
Size of Agreement
¡°We¡¯re going to get a small package and pray that it gets us past the election,¡± said Andy Stern, a Democrat and former president of the Service Employees International Union who served last year on Obama¡¯s bipartisan commission that studied ways to reduce the federal debt.
After last week¡¯s collapse of a bipartisan effort, led by Vice President Joe Biden, aimed at brokering a multitrillion-dollar deal, Obama engaged directly in talks with Republicans yesterday by meeting for more than an hour with McConnell. Neither side provided details of the discussion.
¡°The big boys are doing the negotiating now,¡± said Marc Goldwein, former associate director of the debt commission.
¡°Even if they wanted a $4 trillion deal, there isn¡¯t time in a two- to three-week period to write it legislatively,¡± said Goldwein, now policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based organization that examines fiscal policy. ¡°The important thing is the biggest down payment as possible with at least a symbolic first step on entitlements.¡±
No Short-Term Deal
White House officials and most Republicans are insisting that they don¡¯t want a short-term agreement, which would force Congress to revisit the debt-ceiling issue later this year or next year as the narrative in Washington shifts toward the 2012 presidential election.
Even so, they are underscoring their opposition to compromise on the biggest drivers of the long-term debt. Yesterday McConnell declared tax increases ¡°politically impossible¡± and said, ¡°If government spending was the answer to an economic slowdown, we¡¯d be in a boom right now.¡±
Democrats are holding fast on the tax issue, at least for now. ¡°You have to have revenue on the table, and you have to make cuts,¡± House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California said June 26 on CNN¡¯s ¡°State of the Union.¡± Going into default, is ¡°very bad for the economy, and I hope their friends on Wall Street will tell them that.¡±
Democrats also insist that significant revisions to Medicare and Social Security are off the table.
¡®At an Impasse¡¯
¡°The two parties really are at an impasse,¡± said Rudolph G. Penner, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
¡°Markets should already be very concerned about where we¡¯re going even if we do have some temporary resolution of the debt ceiling,¡± he said. ¡°I don¡¯t see it being repaired without a crisis.¡±
To avoid a short-term increase, the two sides will either need to find $2 trillion in savings or sign off on a smaller package that includes some sort of a budget enforcement mechanism instituting automatic spending cuts and tax increases, said John Spratt, a former Democratic House member from South Carolina who was chairman of the House Budget Committee and also served on Obama¡¯s debt commission.
Discretionary Spending Cuts
The backbone of a debt deal includes discretionary spending cuts, which the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington estimates could total $600 billion over 10 years, including spending on foreign aid. Cutting so-called mandatory spending outside of health care, such as agricultural subsidies, could save an additional $100 billion over 10 years, according to estimates by the center, a policy research group founded by former Senate majority leaders from both parties.
That¡¯s where the hard part comes in, with the two parties forced to decide whether and how much to trade on Medicare and tax increases and Pentagon spending cuts.
Making changes to Medicare, such as asking the wealthy to pay a higher price for their premiums, is one idea that has been raised. Democrats have long opposed such a change, arguing it would undermine popular support for the government-run health care program for the elderly.
Still, there are signs they may be softening, with prominent Democrats like Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, who holds the party¡¯s No. 2 position in the chamber, saying the issue needs to be on the table.
Inflation Calculations
Among the recommendations of Obama¡¯s debt commission was a change in the way the government calculates the rate of inflation, resulting in lower cost-of-living increases and other entitlement benefits. The so-called chained consumer price index, an alternative measurement for the Consumer Price Index, reflects the effect of substitution that consumers make across categories of goods and items in response to changes in relative prices. A switch to that method could save about $300 billion over the next decade, according to an analysis by the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget.
While such a plan has drawn stiff opposition from House Democrats, who say it amounts to a benefit cut for current beneficiaries, it has been on the table both as part of the Biden talks and among a bipartisan group of senators -- known as the Gang of Six -- working on a long-term debt plan.
Finally, an area ripe for cutbacks is the Pentagon budget, said David Walker, who served as U.S. comptroller general from 1998 to 2008 under Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican George W. Bush.
¡®Huge Waste¡¯
¡°There¡¯s huge waste in defense,¡± he said, ¡°and both sides have targeted some defense cuts.¡±
In January, Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed a five-year spending plan with $78 billion of net savings from canceling some weapons programs, reducing troop numbers and cutting overhead. Republicans backed Gates¡¯s goal in a budget plan that passed the House in April.
The most contentious issue of all may be taxes.
As part of his proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 released Feb. 14, Obama proposed $357 billion in revenue-raisers, which would include ending subsidies to oil and gas companies -- a proposal that failed last month in the Senate. Republicans need to ¡°take on some of their sacred cows,¡± Carney said yesterday.
The White House would also tax private-equity or hedge fund managers at higher income-tax rates instead of lower capital-gains rates, change the depreciation formula on corporate jets and limit itemized deductions for wealthy taxpayers.
It also proposed repealing a tax benefit for an inventory accounting practice used by many manufacturers and retailers, which the CBO estimates would be worth $72 billion by 2016.
Republican Hesitation
Cutting a deal on taxes would involve a break with Grover Norquist, the head of the anti-tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform, who insists that any elimination of tax breaks must be accompanied by an equal reduction in taxes elsewhere.
¡°The real problem, from my standpoint, is the Republicans hesitating to do anything on the revenue side, even if it¡¯s trying to target tax expenditures,¡± Walker said.
House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, may soon come to the realization that he needs Democrats to get any debt-ceiling bill through a Democratic-controlled Senate and signed by a Democratic president, even as the Tea Party caucus threatens to vote against a debt-ceiling increase unless he delivers a spending-cut-only accord.
¡°He¡¯s got to get a majority of the Republican caucus,¡± Walker said. ¡°He doesn¡¯t have to get a majority of the Tea Party caucus.¡±

189,Endemol Shares Written Down to Zero by Spanish Owner Telecinco,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Gestevision Telecinco SA, the Spanish television programmer and part-owner of Endemol NV, said it wrote down shares in the ¡°Big Brother¡± producer to zero.
¡°What we have here is just a writedown,¡± Telecinco¡¯s Chief Financial Officer Javier Uria said today on a conference call. ¡°Everything is normal¡± regarding the company¡¯s ability to pay interest, he said.
Telecinco spent 65 million euros ($90 million) buying back Endemol¡¯s senior and junior loans last month, Uria said today in the conference call. Following the buyback, 31 million euros has been added to the share capital of Endemol, Uria said.
Telecinco, Cyrte Fund II BV, Mediaset SpA and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bought Endemol in 2007, using 2.8 billion euros of loans. Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs and Barclays Plc arranged the financing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Hilversum, Netherlands-based company¡¯s flagship ¡°Big Brother¡± show films strangers living together in a house isolated from the outside world.
Endemol¡¯s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization fell to 137.5 million euros in the nine months ending September from 145 million last year, according to Telecinco. Endemol may ¡°restructure its debt on an opportunistic basis,¡± according to an Aug. 23 report by Credit Agricole¡¯s Cheuvreux unit.
The company¡¯s 750 million euro senior loans are quoted at 72.25 cents on the euro today, compared with 72 yesterday, said a dealer, who declined to be identified because the trades are private.

190,¡®Big Brother¡¯ Winner Shetty Starts Indian Property Discount Site,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, winner of the ¡°Celebrity Big Brother¡± reality show in 2007, is teaming up with developer Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd. to start a group home buying website in India.
Groupco Infracom Pvt., partly owned by Shetty, will introduce the website grouphomebuyers.com today, according to a statement. Buyers can log onto the site for their property related searches, and Groupco will negotiate with developers for bulk discounts.
¡°Grouphomebuyers harnesses the power of group buying and empowers each individual home buyer to get significant volume discounts which are almost unachievable individually,¡± said Hem Tejuja, managing director of Groupco Infracom.
Groupco joins companies including Groffr, which are seeking to tap demand for homes in India where the economy is forecast to grow about 8 percent this year. Groffr, a startup founded by former executives of the Kotak Mahindra Group last year, sells homes, cars and electronics through its website targeting graduates of India¡¯s top colleges.
The country¡¯s young population, low mortgage penetration, rapid urbanization and a trend toward nuclear-family homes will boost demand for homes in the world¡¯s fastest-growing major economy after China, according to a report by UBS AG in May. The country, with an estimated housing shortage of 24.7 million units, needs 10 million homes in urban areas alone, it said.
Groupco will also help buyers with the documentation and due diligence of the property, it said.
Shetty, the Indian actress whose bullying at the hands of contestants on the ¡°Celebrity Big Brother¡± television program drew international attention, owns a cricket team in the Indian Premier League with her husband Raj Kundra, as well as a food chain in the U.K. She also has a perfume line, yoga fitness DVDs and runs spas in Mumbai under the brand Iosis.

191,¡®Big Fish¡¯ Indian Investor Loses Glow at Spanish Soccer Club,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 6 (Bloomberg) -- The first Indian investor in Spanish soccer is losing his luster among fans of Racing Santander.
Ahsan Ali Syed, who owns Bahrain-based financial-services company Western Gulf Advisory, missed a payment that was part of the sale agreement to acquire the top-tier team, according to the regional Spanish government of Cantabria. Players are protesting about 1.7 million euros ($2.5 million) of unpaid wages and the coach quit last week. Ali Syed said in an interview that he halted some payments until the previous owner resolves a family dispute that could trigger a legal challenge to his purchase.
Ali Syed follows previous investors in Racing who have seen a chance to boost their profile and network at matches against bigger clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona, according to Ana Carrera, a former team executive who is an economics professor at the University of Cantabria. The 38-year-old Indian arrived on a private jet, checked into the swankiest hotel and hired a fleet of Mercedes for his entourage, Fernando Ortiz, president of Racing fan group Pena Zalo, said.
¡°He seemed to be the real thing: a big fish,¡± said Ortiz, who shook hands with Ali Syed and chatted with him through a translator when he arrived. ¡°Now we are worried things aren¡¯t what they seemed.¡±
Racing is based in the northern city of Santander, which has a population of 180,000, and counts Banco Santander SA chairman Emilio Botin among its fans. The team finished sixth in the 20-team La Liga as recently as 2008 and came 12th last season, which ended May 22. Ali Syed, who ended negotiations to buy Blackburn Rovers last year, says buying Racing ¡°suited his pocket¡± better than the English Premier League team. He says he sees an opportunity in a growing popularity in soccer in India and the Middle East.
¡®No Default¡¯
As part of the deal to buy Racing from Jacobo Montalvo, Ali Syed agreed to pay 6.7 million euros the team owed to the regional government, said an official said, who declined to be identified in line with government policy. The government of Cantabria activated a bank guarantee after Ali Syed missed an installment last month, the official said. Ali Syed said there was ¡°no default¡± because the government received his payment via an escrow account.
Santander¡¯s Mayor Inigo de la Serna said it appeared the regional government had been ¡°politically negligent¡± by not checking Ali Syed¡¯s finances before the sale, according to an April 28 statement from his office. The regional administration says its contract with Ali Syed allows it to cancel his acquisition of Racing if he fails to meet further installments, the government official said. Ali Syed said he intends to meet all his obligations.
¡®Don¡¯t Panic¡¯
¡°There is no need to be in a panic situation in all,¡± Ali Syed said in a telephone interview. ¡°In any fresh takeover there can be issues and there are minor tweaking issues we are trying our level best to resolve.¡±
Ali Syed said he has paid about 2.5 million euros to the government and 1.4 million euros of the club¡¯s tax debt. He said he hasn¡¯t paid the wages owed to players dating back to last year because he¡¯s waiting for Montalvo to resolve what he called a family dispute that was ¡°hidden¡± from him until the night before his acquisition.
Racing Santander officials couldn¡¯t provide contact details for Montalvo and an e-mail sent to his father Javier¡¯s secretary wasn¡¯t returned.
Coach Marcelino Garcia blamed Ali Syed¡¯s delays when he quit on June 3.
Ali Syed ¡°deceived us and took us for a ride,¡± Garcia said in a televised press conference. ¡°Because of a guy from India, the club has come to a standstill.¡±
Ali Syed¡¯s delay in payments has given some fans doubts.
¡°We thought a gentleman was coming with a lot of money, but now there¡¯s nothing,¡± said Pedro Cava, president of the Aupa Racing fan club.
Ali Syed said supporters¡¯s expectations were too high.
¡°I have never promised to invest exorbitant amounts in the club: don¡¯t expect me to invest heavily or aggressively because I cannot,¡± Ali Syed said. ¡°I cannot build Rome in one day.¡±

192,¡®Big Four¡¯ Audit Firms May Face U.K. Antitrust Probe This Month,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 4 (Bloomberg) -- Britain¡¯s antitrust regulator said it will decide this month whether to open a probe into market dominance by the ¡°Big Four¡± accounting firms, focusing on bank loans that force borrowers to use the largest auditors.
A U.K. House of Lords committee investigating the financial crisis said in a March report that the firms, which audit 99 of the 100 largest U.K. companies, should be probed by the London-based Office of Fair Trading to determine whether their market dominance wrongfully limits choice. The probe could be the most high-profile for the agency since it investigated banks¡¯ equity underwriting practices -- an inquiry that closed without any action being taken.
The OFT would help determine whether loan terms unfairly favor Deloitte LLP, Ernst & Young LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and KPMG LLP, said Robert Bell, an antitrust lawyer in London with Speechly Bircham. The agency, which has kept the industry under review since 2002, will make a decision on the probe later this month, said spokeswoman Kasia Reardon.
¡°The requirement by banks to use one of only four accounting firms does suggest there¡¯s some restriction or distortion of competition,¡± Bell said in an interview. ¡°Whether that can be objectively explained away is something they would be looking at.¡±
An investigation by the OFT would ¡°bring to a head the long-running debate on competition and choice,¡± said Mark Hamilton, a London-based KPMG spokesman. The other auditors said they would cooperate with any probe.
Loan Covenants
The loan covenants, one of several practices highlighted in the government report, require borrowers use one of the four firms to review their books in light of their international reputations and perceived ability to handle complex reviews.
Ernst & Young will cooperate with any investigation, said London-based spokeswoman Sarah Jurado. Deloitte and PwC, both based in New York, said in statements that they support an investigation into the existence of restrictive banking covenants.
In a November 2010 submission to the House of Lords committee, the OFT said the market for audit services to large U.K. companies ¡°may be limited¡± and a ¡°targeted market study¡± of the loan covenants was being considered.
¡°It might be argued that some form of investigation by the OFT is overdue, with little evidence of action since it promised to keep the market under review,¡± said Gustaf Duhs, a lawyer at Stevens & Bolton LLP. ¡°The OFT is protective of its reputation and is likely to feel obliged¡± by the government request.
Non-Audit Companies
The committee also said the OFT should look at limits on non-audit companies owning shares in auditing firms and whether liability deters smaller auditors from taking on large clients.
The regulator received a ¡°clear recommendation¡± from the committee to undertake a more wide-ranging review, according to Euan Burrows, a lawyer with Ashurst LLP in London.
Should the OFT go ahead with the probe, it will likely end with a referral to Britain¡¯s ¡°second phase¡± antitrust regulator, the Competition Commission, which can ban the loan covenants, Burrows said.
The U.K. plans to merge the two regulators amid criticism the OFT is too slow and handles too few precedent-setting cases. Its biggest fines were slashed by an appeals court in March and April and its first criminal case collapsed at trial last year.
¡°The OFT is obviously in a very sensitive position given these reform proposals and it wants to be seen to be an effective enforcer,¡± said Bell.
The regulator¡¯s probe will likely focus on the loan terms in the probe so broader audit market competition issues can be reviewed collectively by international regulators, said Duhs.
Individual banks determine the minimum value of loans that require an audit by the Big Four firms, said Brian Capon, a spokesman for the British Bankers¡¯ Association trade group.
¡°This requirement will usually only apply in circumstances such as very large loans to companies, where a particularly high level of expertise or specialism is required,¡± he said.

193,¡®Big Four¡¯ Accounting Dominance Set for U.K. Antitrust Probe,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 21 (Bloomberg) -- The ¡°Big Four¡± accounting firms¡¯ dominance over corporate audits in Britain will be investigated after an antitrust regulator said the market is bad for customers and small competitors.
The U.K. Office of Fair Trading, which has examined the issue since 2002, referred the matter today to the Competition Commission to find any distortions in the industry and potentially force changes. The probe will focus on KPMG LLP, Deloitte LLP, Ernst & Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
¡°The market for large company audits lacks sufficient competition and does not work well for customers,¡± John Fingleton, the OFT¡¯s chief executive officer, said in the statement. ¡°It is highly concentrated, largely supplied by four big firms, with clients rarely switching between auditors.¡±
Large audit firms also face potential European Union restrictions on offering consulting services and may be forced to share work with smaller rivals. The OFT said the U.K. investigation will complement the parallel EU probe and address competition concerns found only in Britain.
¡°The nature, content and timing of EU legislation are not settled and the OFT believes that there are a number of important inputs that the Competition Commission might make during the legislative process,¡± the OFT said in the statement.

The Competition Commission will likely demand a significant amount of time and information from the four firms during the probe, and has authority to impose a variety of changes in the industry, said Rosemary Choueka, who leads the EU competition team at the law firm Lawrence Graham LLP in London.
¡°They could include limiting the duration of audit appointments, or regulating the terms of such appointments, or even requiring the Big Four to divest some of their audit business to other accountancy firms or a new entrant,¡± Choueka said.
A U.K. government committee investigating the global financial crisis earlier called for a probe of the Big Four, which earned 99 percent of audit fees paid by the 100 largest U.K. companies last year, according to the OFT. The watchdog made a provisional finding for the investigation on July 29.
David Sproul, Deloitte U.K.¡¯s chief executive officer, and KPMG spokesman Mark Hamilton said in statements that the U.K. audit market is already competitive and that the companies will cooperate in the probe.
¡®Fierce Rivalry¡¯
Richard Sexton, a PwC board member, said there is ¡°fierce rivalry¡± in the market and that the biggest U.K. companies need the expertise of international audit firms.
Large companies ¡°are sophisticated, demanding and discerning buyers of professional services,¡± Sexton said in a statement. ¡°Their operations are often complex and international.¡±
Ernst & Young¡¯s head of assurance for Britain and Ireland, Hywel Ball, said the company supports some measures to increase choice for customers, such as removing ¡°Big Four only¡± restrictions for audits and liberalising accounting firm ownership rules.
The OFT has said the size of the Big Four¡¯s market share is propelled by the cost of switching auditors, the ease of explaining the choice of accounting firms to investors, the extensive international networks held by bigger auditors and the risk associated with auditing larger companies.

194,"¡®Big Four¡¯ Probe, EU Utilities, Regulators Named: Compliance","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The ¡°Big Four¡± accounting firms¡¯ dominance over corporate audits in Britain will be investigated after an antitrust regulator said the market is bad for customers and small competitors.
The U.K. Office of Fair Trading, which has examined the issue since 2002, referred the matter Oct. 21 to the Competition Commission to find any distortions in the industry and potentially force changes. The probe will focus on KPMG LLP, Deloitte LLP, Ernst & Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Large audit firms also face potential European Union restrictions on offering consulting services and may be forced to share work with smaller rivals. The OFT said the U.K. investigation will complement the parallel EU probe and address competition concerns found only in Britain.
The OFT has said the size of the Big Four¡¯s market share is propelled by the cost of switching auditors, the ease of explaining the choice of accounting firms to investors, the extensive international networks held by bigger auditors and the risk associated with auditing larger companies.

Compliance Policy EU Rules May Force Utilities to Raise Capital, Shearman Says
The European Union¡¯s plan for regulating energy and commodity markets may require power utilities and commodity traders to raise fresh capital, said a lawyer from Shearman & Sterling LLP.
The EU¡¯s plan to expand its Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid, rules will seek to regulate companies not subject to financial regulation such as energy utilities and commodity businesses, said Thomas Donegan, a senior associate in London at Shearman & Sterling, which advises financial institutions and utilities on regulation. Those companies may currently have regulatory exemptions, he said.
The EU Oct. 20 proposed new regulations to reduce market volatility, increase regulatory oversight and promote competition. Specific measures include requiring trading venues to either cap the number of commodity derivative contracts that traders can enter into, or make ¡°alternative arrangements¡± with the same effect.
After losing exemptions, some companies may need to set aside capital that would otherwise be spent on projects or raise cash by issuing shares or subordinated debt, Donegan said. Some exemptions are still available, he said.
EU energy associations urged the bloc¡¯s executive and national governments to exempt the industry from financial rules proposed Oct. 20, citing concern that over-regulation may curb investment.
Indonesia Tussle Over Financial Body Ends as Government Prevails
Indonesia ended months of impasse over the board composition of a planned financial regulator as lawmakers yielded to the government¡¯s efforts to reduce the risk of political interference in bank supervision.
The Financial Services Authority parliamentary working committee agreed Oct. 20 to the government¡¯s plan for two former finance ministry and central bank members on the agency¡¯s board of commissioners, along with seven presidential picks vetted by parliament, Achsanul Qosasi, a vice chairman of the committee, said by phone in Jakarta Oct. 20. Parliament had wanted two of its members in the mix.
The new regulator, known in the Indonesian language as Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, or OJK, is due to start operating in January 2013, supervising capital markets, insurers, pension funds and other non-bank institutions, Qosasi said. Oversight of commercial banks will start from January 2014, he said.
The World Bank and Moody¡¯s Investors Service are among those who have called for financial regulators to be non-politicized in a nation that has for years attempted to rein in corruption.

EU Should Impose Minimum Carbon Price, Border Tax, Group Says
The European Union should impose a minimum price for carbon permits in its emissions trading system and install a CO2 tax on imports into the region, according to the Centre for European Reform.
The border tax adjustments would apply to goods imported from countries where manufacturers aren¡¯t obliged to pay carbon costs, Stephen Tindale, an associate fellow at the London-based policy research group said in a report published Oct. 21.
EU Weighs New Fund to Attract Outside Money to Fight Crisis
European leaders descended on Brussels in a last-ditch effort to stamp out a two-year-old financial crisis that threatens to tip the world into a recession.
Government chiefs took over, following two days of meetings by finance ministers with another set for Oct. 26. That¡¯s their self-imposed deadline to complete a plan to beef up the euro bailout fund, cut Greece¡¯s debt without triggering a default, shield banks from the fallout and ensure Italy and Spain don¡¯t succumb to the contagion.
European finance ministers are considering setting up a fund to entice outside investors to buy troubled euro-area government bonds, as they struggled over how to tame the Greece-fueled debt crisis, said a person familiar with the matter.
The insured investment vehicle was one of two options being weighed, along with using the European Financial Stability Facility to boost the rescue firepower from 440 billion euros ($611 billion) currently, the person said.
Europe¡¯s room for maneuver narrowed last week with a report that Greece¡¯s economy is deteriorating, piling on pressure to build a stronger anti-crisis firewall by the self-imposed Oct. 26 deadline. Measures being considered include a boost in bailout funds to 940 billion euros, deeper writedowns on Greek debt, and a demand that banks increase Tier 1 capital to 9 percent by mid-2012.

Compliance Action Swiss Banks Said Ready to Pay Billions, Disclose Customer Names
Swiss banks will likely settle a sweeping U.S. probe of offshore tax evasion by paying billions of dollars and handing over names of thousands of Americans who have secret accounts, according to two people familiar with the matter.
U.S. and Swiss officials are concluding negotiations on a civil settlement amid U.S. criminal probes of 11 financial institutions, including Credit Suisse Group AG, suspected of helping American clients hide money from the Internal Revenue Service, according to five people with knowledge of the talks who declined to speak publicly because they are confidential.
Switzerland, the biggest haven for offshore wealth, wants an end to new U.S. probes while preserving its decades-old tradition of bank secrecy, the people said. The U.S. seeks data on Americans who have dodged U.S. taxes and a pledge by Swiss banks to stop helping such clients, according to the people. The Swiss reached accords this year with Germany and the U.K. on untaxed assets.
The Swiss government seeks to outline a final accord for the Foreign Affairs Committee of its Parliament¡¯s upper house on Nov. 10, according to a person familiar with the matter. The number of banks that will pay to resolve the U.S. negotiations may extend beyond the 11 under criminal investigation, the people said.

State Regulators in U.S. Combine to Probe Structured-Notes Sales
State regulators in the U.S. are combining forces to investigate whether brokers improperly sold structured notes, securities that package debt with derivatives that are typically offered to individual investors.
About 10 states including Florida and Texas are examining whether the debt instruments were marketed without adequate disclosure of their risks, said Franklin L. Widmann, head of the structured products working group for the North American Securities Administrators Association.
Widmann, who¡¯s also director of securities for Florida¡¯s Office of Financial Regulation, said Oct. 21 in a telephone interview that it¡¯s not clear to the association that people who invested in the products ¡°in certain circumstances even realized the risks.¡± He declined to comment further about the ongoing investigation.
Florida joined Massachusetts and Georgia in July in probing sales of structured notes such as reverse convertibles, which convert into stock if a company¡¯s shares plummet. The ¡°complex¡± securities can be difficult for investors and brokers to evaluate, according to a July 25 statement from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
Sales are poised to match last year¡¯s record $49.5 billion as investors frustrated by record-low interest rates on savings seek higher returns through riskier investments. As sales have grown, brokers may have taken advantage of some individual investors when selling the notes, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in July.

BofA Said to Get Subpoena From California¡¯s Attorney General
Bank of America Corp. was given a subpoena by California¡¯s attorney general for information related to the packaging and sale of mortgage-backed securities, a person familiar with the matter said.
The subpoena, delivered Oct. 18, involves mortgage securitization by the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank and its Countrywide Financial unit, said the person, who wasn¡¯t authorized to speak and didn¡¯t want to be identified
The subpoena follows a decision by California Attorney General Kamala Harris to withdraw from talks among state officials, the U.S. Justice Department and the five largest mortgage servicers.
The attorneys general of all 50 states last year announced they were investigating the foreclosure practices of banks following disclosures that faulty documents were being used to seize homes. A group of attorneys general and federal officials are negotiating a settlement with the lenders, which also include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Ally Financial Inc.
Several attorneys general are conducting their own investigations of bank mortgage practices and have raised concerns about the scope of the releases that would be included in any agreement.
Shum Preston, a spokesman for Harris, declined to comment Oct. 20 on the subpoena. Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, also declined to comment on it. News about the subpoena was first reported in the Los Angeles Times.
Johnson & Johnson, Novartis Face Antitrust Probe on Generics
Johnson & Johnson and Novartis AG are under investigation by the European Union¡¯s antitrust regulator over contracts that may have hampered the sale of generic versions of pain killer Fentanyl in the Netherlands.
The EU authority said it¡¯s probing contractual arrangements between J&J and Novartis that may have had the ¡°object or effect of hindering entry¡± of the generic drug onto the Dutch market. Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis owns Sandoz, a generic-drug maker.
Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are focusing on how settlements between companies that make branded medicines and generics producers might harm consumers. Bayer AG was among drug firms told by EU officials in January to submit details of patent-settlement deals that may be used to delay the sale of generic versions of medicines. Drug developers use various ways to delay generics, the EU said in a 2009 report.
The investigation is related to a contractual agreement J&J had with Sandoz in the Netherlands and is limited to that country, Stefan Gijssels, a spokesman for J&J¡¯s Janssen subsidiary, said in a telephone interview Oct. 20. The company will cooperate fully with authorities, he said.
¡°It¡¯s important to underline that the commission has not made a finding that Janssen did something wrong in the Netherlands,¡± Gijssels said. ¡°It¡¯s the start of an investigation.¡±
¡°We don¡¯t comment on ongoing procedures,¡± Eric Althoff, a spokesman for Novartis, said in an e-mail.
EU Probes Arcelor Mittal, Vimetco Romanian Units on Energy
European Union competition regulators are investigating the Romanian units of Arcelor Mittal and Vimetco NV for allegedly buying electricity at below market prices from the country¡¯s hydropower operator, Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.
The European Commission is looking ¡°into potential aid¡± given to steel producer Arcelor Mittal Galati SA and aluminum smelter Alro SA through lower electricity tariffs from state-owned company Hidroelectrica SA, Almunia said in a speech in Bucharest Oct.21.
The EU is urging Romania, its newest member together with Bulgaria, to liberalize electricity and gas prices and overhaul its unprofitable state-owned energy companies.
Courts Kimelman Appeals Conviction, Sentence for Insider Trading
Michael Kimelman, the co-founder of Incremental Capital LLC, appealed his conviction and sentence for insider trading.
Kimelman, sentenced Oct. 12 to 2 1/2 years in prison, appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, according to a court filing dated Oct. 20. He was found guilty in a bribery scheme involving secret information about companies including 3Com Corp. and Hilton Hotels Corp. Also found guilty were brothers Zvi and Emanuel Goffer.
Kimelman was sentenced a day before Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group LLC, received an 11-year sentence for insider trading. Kimelman¡¯s lawyers include Michael Sommer.
The case is USA v. Goffer, 10-00056, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
Hedge Fund CEO Brownstein Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading
Bo Brownstein, the founder and chief executive officer of Denver-based Big 5 Asset Management, pleaded guilty to trading on inside information about a corporate merger.
Brownstein made more than $5 million in illegal profits for his hedge fund and for relatives by trading on a tip in advance of Apache Corp.¡¯s $2.7 billion acquisition of Mariner Energy Inc. in April 2010, the government said.
The tip originated with H. Clayton Peterson, of Denver, a retired former Arthur Andersen partner who served on Mariner Energies board of directors, prosecutors said. His son, Drew, a Denver financial adviser, pleaded guilty to the same charges.
The case is: U.S. v. Peterson, 11-CR-665, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Comings and Goings Financial Regulators Approved by Senate to Play Dodd-Frank Roles
The U.S. Senate confirmed three of President Barack Obama¡¯s nominees for financial-regulator posts, including additions to the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission who will have a say in Dodd-Frank Act rulemaking.
Lawmakers Oct. 21 approved Republican Daniel M. Gallagher and incumbent Democrat Luis A. Aguilar as SEC commissioners and Mark P. Wetjen to serve on the CFTC.
Gallagher, a former SEC deputy division chief, will join Aguilar and the agency¡¯s other three commissioners as the agency works to implement more than 100 rules it was assigned to write under Dodd-Frank. Wetjen, a policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, will replace Democrat Michael Dunn on the five-member CFTC, which is writing rules for the $601 trillion global swaps market.
Acting FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg, Obama¡¯s choice to lead the agency, and Thomas Curry, the FDIC board member nominated to become comptroller of the currency; and Richard Cordray, the president¡¯s pick to lead the consumer bureau, are awaiting Senate confirmation after they were approved by the Banking Committee.
The confirmations came the day after Obama nominated former Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Thomas Hoenig Oct. 20 to serve as the FDIC¡¯s vice chairman.

195,JPMorgan Says ¡®Big Mistake¡¯ to Signal 82 Yen Barrier,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 16 (Bloomberg) -- One of Japan¡¯s top officials made a ¡°big mistake¡± by indicating a barrier for the yen¡¯s exchange rate against the dollar, inviting an attack by speculators, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku, asked at a press conference in Tokyo whether the 82 yen per dollar level was being defended, said ¡°that¡¯s what the finance ministry seems to think.¡± Japan yesterday intervened in the currency market for the first time since 2004, selling yen after it reached the highest level since 1995.
¡°It¡¯s inevitable that the yen will strengthen again, and the yen at 82 will become the focus for speculation that the government will intervene again,¡± said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and foreign-exchange research at JPMorgan, who earlier this week said intervention odds had doubled after the conclusion of Japan¡¯s ruling party leadership contest. ¡°Once the yen breaks 82 we could see a jump all the way to 79.75.¡±
The yen tumbled from a 15-year high after the government¡¯s move to curb gains that threatened an export-led recovery. The decision came a day after Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan won re-election as the head of the ruling party, beating a candidate who had insisted intervention was necessary.
The yen slid pared yesterday¡¯s losses after the currency tumbled the most in 22 months. It was as strong as 82.88 yesterday before the government intervened, the highest level since May 1995.
¡®Really Stupid¡¯
Sengoku¡¯s remarks prompted lawmaker Yoshimi Watanabe, leader of the opposition Your Party, to say today in Tokyo the comments were ¡°really stupid,¡± the Yomiuri newspaper reported.
Sasaki, who is based in Tokyo and is a former head currency trader at Japan¡¯s central bank, added that Japan¡¯s decision to intervene won¡¯t effectively curb the yen¡¯s gains.
¡°Obviously the exchange rate could move by 1, 2, 3 yen in the short-term, but in the medium-term it can¡¯t change the overall direction¡± of the currency, Sasaki said. ¡°Also, this will make the exchange rate more volatile,¡± something that could end up being a ¡°negative¡± factor for the country¡¯s economy, he said.
Speaking to reporters after the government intervened, Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said yesterday he is prepared to take ¡°bold actions including further intervention¡± if necessary. He declined to comment on currency markets and intervention when asked about the yen today.
The Japanese intervention ¡°shows the amount of pain they¡¯re in¡± and will likely have the government¡¯s intended effect, said Jim O¡¯Neill, chief economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in London. ¡°You¡¯ve got to go with it when MOF intervenes. The yen is going down to 110 in two years.¡±

Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Italian investors reduced their holdings of government bonds and corporate stocks this year with almost 70 percent keeping their savings in cash on expectations that the financial crisis is not over, a survey showed.
The number of consumers holding stock fell to 7 percent from 8 percent last year, savings-bank association ACRI said in the survey released today. About 7 percent of Italians invested in government bonds this year, down from 8 percent in 2009. The number of Italians keeping their savings in cash rose to 68 percent from 62 percent last year, the survey showed.
¡°The survey confirms the general picture of Italians as big savers and people who are risk-averse,¡± Acri Chairman Giuseppe Guzzetti told reporters in Rome today.
The country¡¯s benchmark FTSE MIB Index gained 6.2 percent in the third quarter, while 10-year government bonds fell 5.3 percent during the same period.
¡°Government bonds look less appealing today, given the low level of yield,¡± said Andrea Alemanno, who directed the survey for research institute Ipsos Srl. ¡°Stocks also look less attractive.¡±
The survey of 1,000 consumers took place between Sept. 28 and Oct. 3. The margin of error was between 0.6 and 3.1 percentage points.

197,¡®Big Short¡¯ Author Lewis Asks Judge to Dismiss Libel Suit,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for Michael Lewis, the author of ¡°Liar¡¯s Poker¡± and ¡°Moneyball,¡± asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by a bond manager who claimed Lewis¡¯s book about subprime mortgage investing, ¡°The Big Short,¡± defamed him.
U.S. District Judge George Daniels heard arguments in Manhattan today on Lewis¡¯s motion to dismiss the libel suit by Wing Chau and his company, Harding Advisory LLC, without a trial. Daniels said he will rule ¡°sometime after Labor Day.¡±
¡°There¡¯s not an iota of evidence Michael Lewis thought anything he was writing was false,¡± Celia Barenholtz, a lawyer for Lewis, told the judge. She said Chan was a ¡°limited purpose public figure¡± and hadn¡¯t proved that Lewis¡¯s comments showed ¡°actual malice,¡± a legal standard for libel.
Chau¡¯s Morristown, New Jersey-based Harding Advisory manages collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, which are often backed by pools of mortgage-backed securities. Chau sued Lewis in 2011, claiming that ¡°The Big Short¡± made ¡°false and defamatory statements about him¡± and damaged his reputation in the financial industry.
¡°They should be held accountable,¡± Steven Molo, a lawyer for Chau, said of Lewis and the other defendants. ¡°There should be a jury trial.¡±
Molo told the judge that Chau was a ¡°private person,¡± not a public figure. ¡°Being a prominent manager of CDOs is not enough. He did not inject himself into a public debate.¡± He argued that Lewis¡¯s book ¡°paints Mr. Chau as the worst of the worst¡± CDO managers.
¡®Sleepy¡¯ Companies
Daniels repeatedly questioned Molo about statements from the book that are alleged to be libelous, including Lewis¡¯s comments that Chau had worked for ¡°sleepy¡± insurance companies for much of his career before managing CDOs and that CDO managers didn¡¯t work hard.
¡°Most of your argument is based on the implications of certain statements, not on the actual statements,¡± the judge told Molo. ¡°There¡¯s no proof you can offer to a jury whether an insurance company is ¡®sleepy.¡¯ That is hyperbole. That is opinion.¡±
Chau also sued Lewis¡¯s publisher, New York-based W.W. Norton & Co., and a hedge fund manager, Steven Eisman, who was a principal source of information for Lewis¡¯s book.
The book tells of a group of investors who made fortunes by shorting, or betting against, the residential subprime mortgage market before it collapsed in 2007. Eisman, who managed FrontPoint Partners LLC, was one of those investors.
Harding Investors
Chau¡¯s firm managed about $20 billion worth of CDOs in 2007, making it the fourth largest in that category, according to court papers. Investors in Harding¡¯s CDOs included UBS AG and Deutsche Bank AG, according to court filings. CDO sales collapsed in 2007 along with the subprime-mortgage market.
The book describes a dinner conversation in Las Vegas in 2007 between Chau and Eisman, after which Eisman increased his bets against CDOs. Chau claims Eisman ¡°fabricated the statements¡± attributed to him.
¡°He had no reason to lie,¡± David Schulz, a lawyer for Eisman, said of his client. He argued that the things Eisman told Lewis about the Las Vegas meeting were in fact true, such as Chau wanting to increase his CDO business to $50 billion and not having any equity in the CDOs he managed.
Schulz told the judge that Chau was indeed a public figure. ¡°He chose to go into a highly controversial business, knowing he might be the subject of attention. He chose to become a major player in it.¡±
¡®Eventually Defaulted¡¯
Lewis, who wasn¡¯t in court, said in a written declaration that he sent several messages to Chau seeking an interview for the book and never received a response.
¡°I did not have any reason to doubt my sources, and believe that they were reliable, and the book was accurate,¡± Lewis said in the declaration. ¡°Many of the CDOs under Chau¡¯s management eventually defaulted, and his investors had lost literally billions of dollars.¡±
The book was published in March 2010. It spent more than 28 weeks on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list and has sold more than 1 million copies, according to court records.
¡°If I had any concerns about the accuracy of Lewis¡¯s work, I would not have allowed Norton to publish it,¡± Starling Lawrence, who was Lewis¡¯s editor at Norton, said in a declaration.
Lewis, who is a columnist for Bloomberg View, published his first book, ¡°Liar¡¯s Poker,¡± in 1989 after working in bond sales at Salomon Brothers. It describes the bond trading culture at the investment firm.
Chau¡¯s father fled Mao Zedong¡¯s China in 1953, settled with his family in Rhode Island and ran a restaurant, according to court papers. Chau worked as an analyst for Prudential Securities Inc., among other jobs, before forming Harding in 2006 to manage CDOs.
The case is Chau v. Lewis, 11-01333, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

198,"¡®Big Short¡¯ Author Lewis Sued, Accused of Defaming Wing Chau","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Author Michael Lewis was sued by Wing Chau, president and principal of Harding Advisory LLC, who accused the writer of defaming him in his 2010 book ¡°The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine.¡±
Chau, a manager of collateralized debt obligations, according to a complaint filed Feb. 25 in Manhattan federal court, claims the book unfairly casts him as one of the ¡°villains¡± responsible for the 2008 financial collapse.
The book ¡°depicts Mr. Chau as someone who ignored his professional responsibilities, made misrepresentations to investors, charged money for work that was not performed, had no stake in the CDOs he managed, was incompetent or reckless in carrying out his responsibilities, and violated his fiduciary duties by putting the interests of ¡®Wall Street bond trading desks¡¯ above those of his investors,¡± according to the complaint.
Also named in the suit, which seeks unspecified damages, are the book¡¯s publisher, W.W. Norton & Co., and Steven Eisman, managing director of FrontPoint Partners LLC, whom Chau describes in the complaint as ¡°one of the principal sources Lewis relied on in writing ¡®The Big Short.¡¯¡±
The hardcover edition of the book spent six weeks atop The New York Times¡¯s list of nonfiction bestsellers, according to the complaint. The lawsuit also states that Brad Pitt¡¯s production company has purchased the movie rights and plans to release a film through Paramount Pictures.
Colorful Characters
¡°As a master storyteller, Lewis recognizes that colorful characters -- especially those depicted as heroes and villains - - make for compelling reading,¡± the complaint states. ¡°¡®The Big Short¡¯ is structured accordingly.¡±
Among the alleged defamatory statements in the book is a reference to Chau as ¡°a man who had made it possible for tens of thousands of actual human beings to be handed money they could never afford to repay.¡±
Lewis, a columnist for Bloomberg News, had no comment on the suit. His first book, ¡°Liar¡¯s Poker,¡± was a best-seller about the trading culture at Salomon Brothers, where he had worked.
Norton spokeswoman Elizabeth Riley had no immediate comment.
Chau is described in the complaint as a native of Hong Kong whose family escaped Mao Zedong¡¯s China in 1953 and settled in Rhode Island where his father opened a restaurant. He once worked at Salomon Brothers as an analyst, the suit states.
In 2006 Chau formed Harding, which is also a plaintiff in the suit. It has managed as much as $21 billion in assets, the complaint states.
The case is Chau v. Lewis, 11-cv-1333, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

199,"¡®Biggest Loser¡¯ Macquarie May Sell Guaranteed Debt, RBS Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Macquarie Group Ltd.¡¯s bank unit may sell government-backed bonds to avoid higher debt costs before Australia¡¯s funding guarantee is withdrawn, said John Manning, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.
The guarantee, which was announced in October 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. froze credit markets worldwide, will be withdrawn March 31 because funding conditions have improved, Treasurer Wayne Swan said yesterday.
¡°The biggest loser here looks like Macquarie Bank given its lack of retail presence and strong reliance on wholesale funding markets,¡± said Manning, who is based in Sydney.
¡°I would not be surprised if they have a crack at issuing more government-guaranteed paper before the expiry.¡± Macquarie spokeswoman Fiona Tyndall said she wasn¡¯t authorized to comment before an operational briefing by the company tomorrow.
The guarantee helped Australian banks to raise more than A$121 billion ($105 billion), according to Deutsche Bank AG. Macquarie Bank has A$1.7 billion of debt maturing in 2010 and may largely refinance it by selling government-backed bonds before the program expires, Sydney-based Deutsche Bank analysts Gus Medeiros and Colin Tan said in a research note today.
The decision to remove the backing came even as Australian Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner said yesterday the economy remains in a ¡°fragile¡± condition and Robert Johanson, chairman of regional lender Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd., said that there¡¯s still ¡°a lot of nervousness¡± in parts of the banking industry.
¡®Curious Decision¡¯
¡°I find it a most curious decision to withdraw the guarantee given the current risk aversion in financial markets,¡± Mark Bayley, credit strategist at Sydney-based corporate advisory partnership Aquasia, said in a research note today. ¡°I am far from convinced that those financial institutions outside the top four will be able to access the debt markets at acceptable funding levels without the Commonwealth government guarantee.¡±
Bayley said he favors leaving the guarantee in place as a ¡°useful safety net¡± for those institutions that needed it to raise capital more economically.
Macquarie Bank last sold guaranteed bonds in August, when it raised $150 million from issuing 3.7 percent notes due 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its parent Macquarie Group sold $1 billion of non-guaranteed debt last month, the data show.
The yield on $1.2 billion of 3.3 percent five-year notes sold by Macquarie Bank in July rose to 3.07 percent today from 3.05 percent on Feb. 5, according to prices from Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
AAA Credit Rating
The government guarantee cut funding costs by allowing banks to rely on Australia¡¯s AAA credit rating when selling debt. Australia¡¯s lenders pay a fee of between 70 basis points and 150 basis points a year to the government, based on their credit rating, to use the guarantee.
The fees will total about A$5.5 billion over the life of the guaranteed bonds, according to Swan.
If the guarantee withdrawal means lenders have to sell bonds for more than the margin they were paying to investors on guaranteed debt, plus the fee to the government, their funding costs will increase.

200,Elton John¡¯s ¡®Billy Elliot¡¯ to Shut Down on Broadway in January,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Three years and three months after it danced onto Broadway, the $18 million Elton John musical ¡°Billy Elliot¡± is closing, its producers said today.
Stephanie Lee, president of Group Sales Box Office, said ¡°Billy Elliot¡± producers, including Universal Pictures and Weinstein Live Entertainment, treated her and other ticket agents to an ¡°appreciation lunch¡± last week in the Theater District.
¡°It was a gracious gesture, so it was very surprising to hear the news today,¡± she said. ¡°Everyone thought it would run longer than three years.¡±
The show, about striking British coal miners during the Margaret Thatcher era of denationalization, has been running in London¡¯s West End since 2005. It hasn¡¯t proven as popular with Broadway audiences.
Recently the producers attempted to make the show more appealing to American audiences by changing some of the working-class British slang. They also reduced the amount of profanity in the show.
Based on the 2000 film of the same name, ¡°Billy Elliot¡± is about a boy from a depressed mining town who develops a love for ballet dancing. The show won the 2009 Tony Award for best musical -- and nine other Tonys -- and recouped its initial investment after 14 months.
¡°Billy Elliot¡± grossed $718,000 last week, 54 percent of capacity, according to the Broadway League. Its Jan. 8 shuttering will follow by a week that of ¡°The Addams Family,¡± which will have run 22 months on Broadway.
A magnet for tourists, Broadway has been considered largely immune from stock market drama and U.S. economic woes. The Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index fell 2.9 percent today to 1099, a one-year low.

201,¡¯BioPrefered¡¯ Products a Priority on U.S. Shopping Lists,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 21 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. federal government will increase its emphasis on purchases of bio-based products as a way to bring jobs to rural areas, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said.
Federal workers will also get training in buying items labeled ¡°BioPreferred,¡± Vilsack said today on a conference call with reporters. More than 3,000 companies now create about 20,000 bio-based products including cleaning agents, paints, lubricants and personal-care goods from renewable sources, Vilsack said.
The goal is to create ¡°more contracts, more opportunities for these bio-based businesses,¡± Vilsack said on the call, which included Commerce Secretary John Bryson. ¡°That should lead to more jobs in rural America.¡±
The BioPreferred labeling program, begun in 2009, identifies products make from renewable sources such as corn, with a goal of lowering petroleum consumption. To qualify for the designation, an item must contain enough renewable material to meet or exceed U.S. Department of Agriculture-specified standards.
The government also said it will provide $15 million in awards for projects that promote regional job creation, and increase efforts to help community and technical colleges train new health information-technology workers.

202,Fortress Invests in Studio Behind Oscar Winner ¡®Birdman¡¯,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
New Regency Productions, the company that made the Oscar winners ¡°Birdman¡± and ¡°12 Years a Slave,¡± raised $200 million from funds led by Fortress Investment Group.
The five-year loan, arranged by JPMorgan Chase & Co., will help New Regency fund film production and growth in its re-established television business, the Los Angeles-based company said Thursday. Other financial terms weren¡¯t disclosed. 21st Century Fox Inc. owns a 20 percent stake in New Regency.
The fundraising highlights the return of investors to Hollywood after a pullback in the wake of the financial crisis. While lending hasn¡¯t fully recovered, the growth of digital platforms such as Netflix has spurred demand for content and capital to make movies and TV shows. New Regency produced the Oscars¡¯ best-picture winners for the past two years.
¡°The entertainment sector continues to enjoy a strong demand from bank and institutional investors and this capital raise positions the company for continued growth and success,¡± David Shaheen, a JPMorgan managing director, said in a statement.
New production start-ups such as Broad Green Pictures and A24 have also sprung up in recent years, often with the help of Chinese investors. STX Entertainment, a film producer backed by TPG Capital Management LP, raised funds from Huayi Brothers Media Corp. in April.
New Regency, founded in 1991, co-produced the television series ¡°Malcolm in the Middle,¡± and has been mapping an expansion in TV after retreating from that business in 2009.
Oscar Hopeful
Founder Arnon Milchan, who owns 80 percent, said he was looking to expand the business ¡°aggressively.¡±
The company in January renewed a $500 million film-financing credit facility led by JPMorgan. 21st Century Fox, Rupert Murdoch¡¯s entertainment company, distributes New Regency¡¯s films, in addition to holding a stake.
New Regency is expected to be in contention for the 2016 Oscars with ¡°The Revenant,¡± set for release Dec. 25. It is directed by Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu, who won an Oscar for directing ¡°Birdman.¡±
In ¡°The Revenant,¡± Leonard DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a frontiersman in the 1820s who seeks revenge against men who left him for dead.
New Regency is shooting ¡°A Cure For Wellness¡± by director Gore Verbinski, which is set for release in 2016, and is in pre-production on ¡°Assassin¡¯s Creed,¡± starring Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, and based on the video game of the same name."

204,"¡®Black Day in Zurich,¡¯ Former Players Say About Blatter¡¯s Return","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sepp Blatter¡¯s return as FIFA president has left former soccer players wondering how the man who has presided over the governing body as it lurched from one corruption crisis to another over 17 years could hold onto power for a fifth term.
Blatter, 79, won after his only remaining challenger, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, withdrew after being outvoted 133-73 in the first round of Friday¡¯s balloting.
Blatter¡¯s re-election comes two days after nine FIFA officials were charged by U.S. authorities with crimes including racketeering, bribery and fraud over a 24-year period. Swiss authorities are also investigating the award of the next two World Cups to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022.
¡°I take the responsibility to bring back FIFA. I am confident we can do it,¡± Blatter said in Switzerland.
Reaction included:
Luis Figo, 42, formerly of Real Madrid and Barcelona and 2001 FIFA World Player of the Year, who withdrew from the presidential election on May 21:
¡°Today was another black day in Zurich.
¡®¡®You cannot lead FIFA making a mockery of the most basic rules of transparency, the rule of law and democracy.
¡®¡®The fact that the man responsible for FIFA reaching this point has been re-elected shows the organization is sick.¡¯¡¯
Gary Lineker, 54, who scored an English record 10 World Cup goals:
¡®¡®All those FIFA members that voted for Blatter have betrayed the game they are supposed to cherish.
¡®¡®The only way this revolting organization will change is if the major football federations walk out.¡¯¡¯
Louis Saha, 36, former Manchester United striker and member of France¡¯s national team:
¡®¡®The amount of global media attention this story has generated is pretty much unprecedented; to the point where it¡¯s taken away the attention from the actual sport.
¡®¡®Who the president of FIFA is shouldn¡¯t matter -- the focus needs to be on the sport and nothing else. What we¡¯re currently faced with is a top tier that¡¯s got too much power to the point where it¡¯s damaging the industry at large.¡¯¡¯
Kyle Martino, 34, former U.S. international and NBC commentator for Major League Soccer:
¡®¡®As boss #Sepp, the only thing worse than knowledge of widespread company immorality is no knowledge of it.¡¯¡¯
Sunil Gulati, U.S. Soccer Federation president who voted for Prince Ali after nominating him in January.
¡®¡®Our goal is for governance of FIFA that is responsible, accountable, transparent and focused solely on the best interests of the game.
¡®¡®This is what FIFA needs and deserves, and what the people who love our game around the world demand. We congratulate President Blatter and it is our hope he will make reform his number one priority to ensure the integrity of the sport across the world.¡¯¡¯"
205,Taleb Says U.S. Deficits ¡®Probably the Worst of All¡¯,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of ¡°The Black Swan,¡± said he¡¯s concerned budget deficits in the U.S. are spiraling out of control and may now represent a bigger problem than in countries such as Greece.
¡°The U.S. is probably the worst of all,¡± Taleb told Canada¡¯s BNN television network in an interview today. ¡°They are addicted to debt. We have an administration that, unlike the European administrations, is not aware of the risks of mounting deficits, of the addiction to public deficits and to big government.¡±
Taleb told the cable network, ¡°People are complaining about Greece, but Greece has the IMF putting some discipline in their system. Who can discipline the U.S. government?¡±
Greece this year has imposed a series of austerity measures, including wage and pension cuts and higher sales taxes, in exchange for a 110 billion-euro ($148 billion) rescue from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. U.S. President Barack Obama inherited what the National Bureau of Economic Research said this week was the deepest U.S. recession since the Great Depression. The government¡¯s outstanding debt is about $13.5 trillion, according to Treasury figures.
Risks to the global financial system are much larger than before the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Taleb said.
¡®Making Things Worse¡¯
¡°People still don¡¯t understand why we had the crisis and they don¡¯t realize that we are making things worse,¡± he said. ¡°We still have the same level of debt but we are transforming private debt into public debt. We are socializing these risks, and the system has fewer people employed. So we have a lot more risks than we did in 2007.¡±
Taleb, in Montreal today to give a speech to a group of business people, said Canada¡¯s fiscal situation makes the country a safer investment than its southern neighbor.
Canada has the lowest ratio of net debt to gross domestic product among the Group of Seven industrialized countries and will keep that distinction until at least 2014, the finance department said in its March budget documents. Canada¡¯s ratio, 24 percent in 2007, will rise to about 30 percent by 2014. The U.S. ratio, now above 40 percent, will top 80 percent in four years, the department said, citing IMF data.
¡°I am extremely bearish on the U.S.,¡± he said. ¡°I am more bullish on Canada. Canada is much more robust than the U.S. You guys have much less debt, much more manageable risks.¡±
Taleb wrote the 2007 best-seller ¡°The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,¡± which argues that history is littered with rare, high-impact events. The black-swan theory stems from the ancient misconception that all swans were white.
As the founder of New York-based Empirica LLC, a hedge-fund firm he ran for six years before closing it in 2004, Taleb built a strategy based on options trading to protect investors from market declines while profiting from rallies. He now advises Universa Investments LP, a Santa Monica, California-based fund that bets on extreme market moves.

206,¡®Black Swan¡¯ Author Says Dubai More Robust Than U.S.,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, whose book ¡°The Black Swan¡± described how unforeseen events can roil global markets, said Dubai¡¯s economy is more robust than that of the U.S. as its debt problem can be ¡°controlled.¡±
¡°Even if you take perhaps the worst of emerging markets, a place like Dubai, you realize Dubai is more robust than the United States,¡± Taleb said at a mutual funds conference in Manama, Bahrain today. ¡°Dubai has been borrowing to put buildings on postcards. It can stop that, but America needs to borrow just to open the doors in the morning. That¡¯s why I¡¯m not comfortable with the United States.¡±
Prior to the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008, Taleb warned that bankers were relying too much on probability models and were disregarding the potential for unexpected catastrophes. His book labeled these events black swans, referring to the widely held belief that only white swans existed until black ones were discovered in Australia in 1697, and said that they were becoming more severe.
¡°Dubai, they¡¯re not depending on debt, it¡¯s not a chronic debt, it¡¯s not like the American person who has this dependency on debt and has been building it since the 80s,¡± Taleb, a former derivatives trader, said. ¡°It¡¯s not a great model but it¡¯s more robust than the United States, simply because their debt situation can be controlled a lot better than the U.S.¡±
Repay Debt
U.S. President Barack Obama and his administration weakened the country¡¯s economy by seeking to foster growth instead of paying down the federal debt, Taleb, said in Montreal on Sept. 24. Governments globally need to cut debt and avoid bailing out struggling companies because that¡¯s the only way they can shield their economies from the negative consequences of erroneous budget forecasts, Taleb said then.
Dubai has faced a debt crisis since November when Dubai World, one of its three main state-owned holding companies, said it would delay payments on about $26 billion of debt. The second-biggest of seven states that make up the United Arab Emirates and its state-owned companies have borrowed $109.3 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund estimates, as the emirate strove to transform itself into a financial, logistic and tourism hub. That is 133 percent of its gross domestic product of $82 billion in 2008, as reported in its bond prospectus published last month.
Obama in September proposed a package of $180 billion in business tax breaks and infrastructure outlays to boost spending and job growth on top of the $814 billion stimulus measure enacted last year. The U.S. government¡¯s total outstanding debt is about $13.5 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department figures. That is 94 percent of its 2009 GDP of $14.3 trillion, according to Bloomberg data.

207,Taleb Says Financial Industry Bonuses Should Be ¡®Symmetric¡¯,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the ¡°The Black Swan,¡± said bonuses to financial executives and traders should be ¡°symmetric¡± with their performance to solve the problem of overconfidence in global markets.
Taleb, a New York University professor, said ¡°flawed incentives¡± caused employees to take ill-advised risks, a practice that led to the financial crisis.
¡°Make capitalism the way it¡¯s got to be, symmetric,¡± Taleb said today in New York at the Buttonwood Gathering hosted by The Economist. ¡°If you make money, you get paid. If you lose money, you take away that free option from the system. Take away the asymmetry.¡±
In his 2007 best-seller, ¡°The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,¡± Taleb describes how unforeseen events can agitate markets. The title comes from the ancient misconception that all swans were white.

208,"Taleb Says Government Bonds to Collapse, Avoid Stocks","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who warned that unforeseen events can roil markets in ""The Black Swan,"" said he is ""betting on the collapse of government bonds"" and that investors should avoid stocks.
¡°I¡¯m very pessimistic,¡± he said at the Discovery Invest Leadership Summit in Johannesburg today. ¡°By staying in cash or hedging against inflation, you won¡¯t regret it in two years.¡±
Treasuries have rallied amid speculation the global economic recovery is faltering, driving yields on two-year notes to a record low of 0.4892 percent today. The Federal Reserve yesterday reversed plans to exit from monetary stimulus and decided to keep its bond holdings level to support an economic recovery it described as weaker than anticipated. The Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index retreated 16 percent between April 23 and July 2, the biggest slump during the bull market.
The financial system is riskier than it was before the 2008 crisis that led the U.S. economy to the worst contraction since the Great Depression, Taleb said.
Prior to the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008, Taleb warned that bankers were relying too much on probability models and were disregarding the potential for unexpected catastrophes. His book labeled these events black swans, referring to the widely held belief that only white swans existed until black ones were discovered in Australia in 1697, and said that they were becoming more severe.
Taleb helped pioneer the concept of hedging against these tail-risk events while trading options in the 1980s for banks such as First Boston Inc., now part of Credit Suisse Group AG. Now a professor at New York University¡¯s Polytechnic Institute, Taleb set up the tail-risk hedge fund Empirica LLC in 1999 and ran it for six years.
In February, he told a conference in Moscow that ¡°every single human being¡± should bet Treasury bonds will decline. It¡¯s a ¡°no-brainer¡± to sell short the debt, he added. Since then, 2- and 10-year notes have rallied.

209,"Obama¡¯s Stimulus Plan Made Crisis Worse, Taleb Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Barack Obama and his administration weakened the country¡¯s economy by seeking to foster growth instead of paying down the federal debt, said Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of ¡°The Black Swan.¡±
¡°Obama did exactly the opposite of what should have been done,¡± Taleb said yesterday in Montreal in a speech as part of Canada¡¯s Salon Speakers series. ¡°He surrounded himself with people who exacerbated the problem. You have a person who has cancer and instead of removing the cancer, you give him tranquilizers. When you give tranquilizers to a cancer patient, they feel better but the cancer gets worse.¡±
Today, Taleb said, ¡°total debt is higher than it was in 2008 and unemployment is worse.¡±
Obama this month proposed a package of $180 billion in business tax breaks and infrastructure outlays to boost spending and job growth. That would come on top of the $814 billion stimulus measure enacted last year. The U.S. government¡¯s total outstanding debt is about $13.5 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department figures.
Obama, 49, inherited what the National Bureau of Economic Research said this week was the deepest U.S. recession since the Great Depression. Even after the stimulus measure and other government actions, the U.S. unemployment rate is 9.6 percent.
Governments globally need to cut debt and avoid bailing out struggling companies because that¡¯s the only way they can shield their economies from the negative consequences of erroneous budget forecasts, Taleb said.
Errant Forecasts
¡°Today there is a dependency on people who have never been able to forecast anything,¡± Taleb said. ¡°What kind of system is insulated from forecasting errors? A system where debts are low and companies are allowed to die young when they are fragile. Companies always end up dying one day anyway.¡±
Taleb, a native of Lebanon who gave his speech in French to an audience of Quebec business people, said Canada¡¯s fiscal situation makes the country a safer investment than its southern neighbor.
Canada has the lowest ratio of net debt to gross domestic product among the Group of Seven industrialized countries and will keep that distinction until at least 2014, the country¡¯s finance department said in March. Canada¡¯s ratio, 24 percent in 2007, will rise to about 30 percent by 2014. The U.S. ratio, now above 40 percent, will top 80 percent in four years, the department said, citing IMF data.
¡°I am bullish on Canada,¡± he told the audience. ¡°I prefer Canada to the U.S. or even Europe.¡±
Mortgage Interest
Canada¡¯s economy also benefits from the fact that homeowners, unlike their U.S. neighbors, can¡¯t take mortgage interest as a tax deduction, Taleb said. That removes the incentive to take on too much debt, he said.
¡°The first thing to do if you want to solve the mortgage problem in the U.S. is to stop making these interest payments deductible,¡± he said. ¡°Has someone dared to talk about this in Washington? No, because the U.S. homebuilders¡¯ lobby is hyperactive and doesn¡¯t want people to talk about this.¡±
Taleb also criticized banks and securities firms, saying they don¡¯t adequately warn clients of the risks they run when they invest their retirement savings in the stock market.
¡®Have Fun¡¯
¡°People should use financial markets to have fun, but not as a depository of value,¡± Taleb said. ¡°Investors have been deceived. People were told that markets go up regularly, but if you look at the last 10 years that¡¯s not been the case. The risks are always greater than what people are told.¡±
Asked by an audience member if returns such as those posted by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett -- who amassed the world¡¯s third-biggest personal fortune through decades of stock picks and takeovers -- are the product of luck or talent, Taleb said both played a part.
If given a choice between investing with Buffett and billionaire investor George Soros, Taleb also said he would probably pick the latter.
¡°I am not saying Buffett isn¡¯t as good as Soros,¡± he said. ¡°I am saying that the probability Soros¡¯s returns come from randomness is much smaller because he did almost everything: he bought currencies, he sold currencies, he did arbitrages. He made a lot more decisions. Buffett followed a strategy to buy companies that had a certain earnings profile, and it worked for him. There is a lot more luck involved in this strategy.¡±
Soros gained fame in the 1990s when he reportedly made $1 billion correctly betting against the British pound.
Taleb¡¯s 2007 best-seller, ¡°The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,¡± argues that history is littered with rare, high-impact events. The black-swan theory stems from the ancient misconception that all swans were white.

210,"World Has ¡°Bigger Problem¡± Than in 2008, Taleb Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
(Corrects spelling of Taleb in fifth paragraph.)
Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the best-selling book ¡°The Black Swan,¡± said the current global market turmoil is worse than it was in 2008 because countries such as the U.S. have larger sovereign-debt loads.
¡°Definitely, we face a bigger problem now and we will pay a higher price,¡± Taleb, who is also a professor at New York University, said today at a news conference in Kiev, referring to the turmoil during the last global financial crisis. ¡°The structure of the problem has still not been understood. We haven¡¯t done anything constructive in three and a half years. Nobody wants to do anything drastic now.¡±
Concerns over the global situation have intensified as Europe¡¯s debt crisis deepened and the U.S. economy showed signs of slowing. Standard & Poor¡¯s lowered the U.S.¡¯s credit rating for the first time in August, criticizing lawmakers for failing to cut spending or raise revenue enough to reduce record budget shortfalls.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled yesterday he¡¯ll push forward with further expansion of monetary stimulus if needed.
Taleb urged countries to keep their budgets balanced, criticizing President Barack Obama of ¡°loading the U.S. with debt that our children will have to pay¡± and said that growth fuelled by government debt isn¡¯t really growth.
¡°Someone made a mistake lending and someone made a mistake borrowing,¡± said Taleb. ¡°It is a mistake to transform private problems into public debt.¡±
The U.S should ¡°be aware of the importance of fiscal wisdom,¡± he said at the news conference, organized by investment bank Investment Capital Ukraine.
Taleb popularized the term black swan, which derives from the once widespread Western belief that all swans were white -- until explorers discovered the black variety in Australia in 1697. He argued that unforeseen events with a large impact on markets occur more frequently than statistical analysis predicts, thereby justifying the high cost of hedging against disasters.

211,¡®Black Swan¡¯ Author More Worried About U.S. Than Europe,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Sept. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the best-selling book ¡°The Black Swan,¡± said he¡¯s more concerned about prospects for the U.S. than Europe because the country lacks awareness of its fiscal woes.
¡°The difference between Europe and the U.S. is the consciousness of the problem,¡± Taleb, a New York University professor, said today at a news conference in Tokyo organized by Bank of America Corp. ¡°There¡¯s no consciousness in the U.S.¡± about the fiscal deficit, he said.
Global financial-market turmoil intensified this quarter as Europe¡¯s sovereign debt crisis deepened and the U.S. economy showed signs of slowing. Standard & Poor¡¯s cut the U.S.¡¯s credit rating for the first time in August, criticizing lawmakers for failing to cut spending or raise revenue enough to reduce record budget shortfalls.
Jacques Attali, a former European banking official, told reporters at the same briefing that the U.S. is in a worse state than Europe because of factors including political paralysis over its debt burden as well as unemployment.
¡°I¡¯m quite pessimistic about the future of the U.S. economy for quite a long time,¡± said Attali, who advised French President Francois Mitterrand in the 1980s and later became the first head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. ¡°The U.S. economy is in very, very bad situation.¡±
Fate of Euro
The euro is likely to avoid collapse and the trouble in the region will help to speed up action by governments, said Attali, who is now president of Planet Finance, an organization that seeks to fight poverty through microfinance.
Europe¡¯s 17-nation currency fell toward its lowest level since 2001 against the yen today on speculation Greece is nearing default and before Italy sells bonds. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a radio interview that she won¡¯t let Greece go into ¡°uncontrolled insolvency¡± because of the risk of contagion for other euro-area countries.
Michael Spence, a Nobel laureate in economics, was less optimistic than Attali when asked about the euro¡¯s prospects at a conference in Beijing today.
¡°If the group as a whole can¡¯t agree on the burden sharing, who¡¯s going to pay the price of solving the problem?¡± he said. ¡°There is probably at least 30 percent chance this could go badly wrong. Maybe more.¡±
No U.S. Crisis
Spence, a professor at New York University¡¯s Stern School of Business who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2001, stopped short of saying the U.S. is in a crisis. ¡°We have a debt problem, we have a political problem dealing with it, and we certainly have a growth and unemployment problem, but it¡¯s not a crisis,¡± he said.
His colleague Taleb, who said in June that the U.S. debt situation is worse than that of Greece, commented on Japan¡¯s record government borrowings. For Japan, the ¡°main problem is the level¡± of its debt, Taleb said, adding that the nation¡¯s high household savings help to compensate.
While Japan has the world¡¯s largest public debt burden, more than 90 percent is held by domestic creditors. Japanese households had 1,476 trillion yen ($19.2 trillion) of financial assets as of March 31, according to the Bank of Japan.
Taleb popularized the term black swan, which derives from the once widespread Western belief that all swans were white -- until explorers discovered the black variety in Australia in 1697. He argued that unforeseen events with a large impact on markets occur more frequently than statistical analysis predicts, thereby justifying the high cost of hedging against disasters.
¡°There is no moral reason why a world so wealthy should have so much debt,¡± Taleb said today.

¡°The Fighter,¡± a drama about Irish-American boxer Micky Ward, and ¡°The Social Network,¡± the fictionalized story of the founding of Facebook Inc., received six nominations each, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association said today during a press conference in Beverly Hills, California.
Nominations often signal likely candidates for Academy Awards, Hollywood¡¯s top honor, and the publicity they generate can lift box-office and DVD sales. Ticket revenue in the U.S. and Canada may surpass last year¡¯s record $10.6 billion, according to Los Angeles-based Hollywood.com Box-Office.
¡°They have agreed two-thirds of the time on best picture for the past 30 years,¡± Tom O¡¯Neil, author of the book ¡°Movie Awards,¡± said in an interview.
The organizations last chose the same best picture in 2009, when director Danny Boyle¡¯s ¡°Slumdog Millionaire¡± won both. The Oscar nominations for 2010 films will be announced Jan. 25.
Sony Pictures received the most nominations of any studio with 14, including ¡°The Social Network.¡± Weinstein Co., distributor of ¡°The King¡¯s Speech,¡± had 10 nominations. Fox Searchlight, owned by News Corp., and Viacom Inc.¡¯s Paramount Pictures, each received seven. Relativity Media LLC, the film finance and production company controlled by Ryan Kavanaugh, and Walt Disney Co. had six apiece.
¡°The King¡¯s Speech¡± stars Firth as George VI, who turns to an eccentric speech therapist, played by Geoffrey Rush, to overcome his stammer. Rush and Helen Bonham Carter received nominations for their supporting roles.
Best Dramas
Other best-drama nominees include ¡°The Fighter,¡± ¡°The Social Network,¡± ¡°Black Swan¡± and ¡°Inception.¡±
In the best musical or comedy category, ¡°Alice in Wonderland,¡± ¡°Burlesque,¡± ¡°The Kids Are All Right,¡± ¡°Red¡± and ¡°The Tourist¡± will compete for the Golden Globe.
The 68th Annual Golden Globe Awards show, to be hosted by comedian Ricky Gervais, will be broadcast live on NBC starting at 8 p.m. New York time on Jan. 16. The nominations for 25 categories were read today by actors Josh Duhamel, Katie Holmes and Blair Underwood during a televised news conference.
The Oscar telecast, to be hosted by James Franco and Anne Hathaway, will be shown Feb. 27 on Walt Disney Co.¡¯s ABC.

213,"¡®Black Swan¡¯ Is ¡®Horrific,¡¯ Says Royal Ballet Star: Interview","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Dec. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Sarah Lamb is held upside down by a dance partner, her legs like half-open scissors, as dissonant violin music screeches through a London practice studio.
Pale and pencil thin, the U.S.-born Royal Ballet principal is rehearsing a Wayne McGregor choreography created on her. As the ballet master asks her to tweak a movement, she says it¡¯ll be hard -- ¡°unless I can put my knee on my head.¡±
At 31, Lamb is dancing better than ever, propelled by her drive and razor-sharp technique. She stars in ¡°Nutcracker¡± as the Sugar Plum Fairy, having performed ¡°Sleeping Beauty,¡± ¡°Manon¡± and McGregor¡¯s ¡°Limen¡± in the five preceding weeks. After a 2008 mid-rehearsal collision that broke four of her bones and kept her away for nine months, she¡¯s making up for lost time, and dancing every remaining minute of her ballerina career.
¡°Ballet is my life: It¡¯s my calling, it¡¯s my passion, and I know it won¡¯t last forever,¡± says Lamb, who wears an unglamorous green track suit in her Royal Opera House dressing room. ¡°I feel like taking it to the absolute maximum.¡±
¡°When I had that taken away, when I had that gone, I felt, ¡®Who am I? Who is Sarah Lamb?¡¯¡± she says of her injury. ¡°I felt like I¡¯d lost my identity.¡±
Our filmed conversation is repeatedly interrupted by a backstage intercom. ¡°Second call for Traviata,¡± it yelps. Lamb picks up where she left off, exactly on cue.
The ballerina was born in Boston to a Canadian mother and a British father, both teachers. As a child, she also drew, painted and played the violin.
Riddle of Dance
Viewing ballet as ¡°a riddle to be undone,¡± she threw herself into it, steered by a strict Russian teacher. ¡°I almost lost my joy of dancing,¡± she recalls. ¡°I became so overly aware of everything that I was possibly doing wrong.¡± Artistry, she quickly realized, mattered more than technique.
Joining the Boston Ballet in 1998, she left in 2004 for the Royal Ballet, where she became a principal two years later. London offered more visibility and a wider repertoire.
What did Lamb make of Darren Aronofsky¡¯s movie ¡°Black Swan,¡± starring Natalie Portman as a self-hurting dancer? ¡°It was horrific,¡± she says. ¡°It had an unfortunate script, and probably one of the worst dialogues I¡¯ve ever heard.¡±
¡°I thought it was going to be a cult classic, something people go and watch and dress up for like ¡®The Rocky Horror Picture Show¡¯ at midnight,¡± she says. ¡°Unfortunately, it was received as a plausible and semi-realistic tale, and Natalie Portman was applauded for having become a ballerina.¡±
No More Tutus
Though ¡°Black Swan¡± boosted box office, it¡¯s not the way forward, she says. To lure young people, ballet companies should program ¡°more current¡± productions with contemporary music and leotards, ¡°rather than a tutu, which nobody has any relation to in the modern world.¡±
Today¡¯s young audiences graduate from contemporary to classical dance, and not the other way around, she says. They should be reeled in with ballets like this year¡¯s ¡°Alice in Wonderland,¡± choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, she says.
I ask why the dominant names in ballet -- Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov -- are male. ¡°Men always get an easier break!¡± she says, only half joking.
¡°In ballet, the few boys that there are, stand out,¡± she explains, ¡°whereas we¡¯re used to having at least 25 girls who can all do about the same thing.¡±
Offstage, the ballerina enjoys reading. After her accident, she got through ¡°War and Peace,¡± and likes Chaucer, Chekhov and Raymond Carver. She reads the New Yorker ¡°voraciously.¡±
Otherwise, down time is spent sleeping and sewing pointes. ¡°I can go through quite a number within a week,¡± she says. ¡°It¡¯s a long process to sew pointe shoes.¡±
What comes after ballet? Probably university, she says -- and turning her dance experience into something else.
¡°I really love rehearsing, not just performing,¡± she says. ¡°I¡¯ll probably take that discipline and commitment and put it into a different field. I just don¡¯t know what yet.¡±
Sarah Lamb performs in ¡°Sleeping Beauty¡± on Dec. 8 and 15, and in ¡°The Nutcracker¡± on Dec. 20 and 30. ¡°The Nutcracker¡± ends its run on Jan. 18, 2012. Information: http://www.roh.org.uk.

214,¡®Black Swan¡¯ Choreographer Millepied to Head Paris Ballet,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Dancer Benjamin Millepied, who choreographed the movie ¡°Black Swan¡± and had a small part in it, will head the Paris Opera Ballet from Oct. 15, 2014.
The 35-year-old will replace Brigitte Lefevre, who has been the institution¡¯s director of dance since 1995, Paris Opera Director Nicolas Joel announced today in Paris.
Millepied will fill a position held by one of the greatest dancers of all time: From 1983 to 1989, Rudolf Nureyev led the company. The Russian prodigy choreographed ballets that are still in the company repertoire, and performed each year.
During his tenure, Nureyev spotted talents such as Sylvie Guillem who went on to become international stars. One of his proteges -- Laurent Hilaire, currently Lefevre¡¯s deputy -- had been viewed as a potential successor until today¡¯s announcement.
Millepied, born in Bordeaux, France, is married to actress Natalie Portman, who won an Oscar for her role as the tormented dancer in Darren Aronofsky¡¯s psychological thriller ¡°Black Swan¡± (2010). They have a son.
At a Paris news conference, Millepied said he and his family were moving to Paris, where Portman would work on European projects.
The choreographer said he approached the job ¡°with great respect and humility,¡± AFP reported. He stressed the ¡°refinement and elegance¡± of its members, and said, ¡°You can recognize a Paris Opera dancer in 10 seconds.¡±
Swan Horror
¡°Black Swan¡± irritated much of the ballet world. In a 2011 interview, Royal Ballet Principal Sarah Lamb -- who is U.S.-born -- termed it ¡°horrific.¡± She regretted that the movie was ¡°received as a plausible and semi-realistic tale,¡± and that Portman was ¡°applauded for having become a ballerina.¡±
Millepied joined the New York City Ballet in 1995 and became a principal dancer in 2002. He performed principal roles in ballets by George Balanchine (¡°Agon,¡± ¡°Coppelia¡±), Jerome Robbins (¡°Dances at a Gathering¡±), and Angelin Preljocaj.
He left New York City Ballet in 2011 to concentrate on choreography and set up his own company, L.A. Dance Project. So far, he has some two dozen choreographies to his name.
In 2006, Millepied was commissioned to choreograph a piece for the Paris Opera Ballet titled ¡°Amoveo,¡± set to extracts from Philip Glass¡¯s ¡°Einstein on the Beach.¡±
In February 2011, his choreography was a highlight of a set of American Ballet Theater performances at the Sadler¡¯s Wells Theatre in London. A parade of men in loose waistcoats and women in Grecian tunics twitched and tossed in a blend of ballet and athletics, accompanied by screechy live music.

215,¡®Black Swan¡¯ Volcano Offers Us Lessons: Matthew Lynn,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
April 21 (Bloomberg) -- For a generation or more, no one ever gave a second thought to Iceland. Now it has shaken up the world twice in a couple of years.
First its banks collapsed in the most dramatic illustration of the fragility of our financial system. Now an Icelandic volcano is spewing ash into the sky, prompting a shutdown of European airspace. The continent is paralyzed. Planes are grounded. Travelers are stuck thousands of miles from their families and workplaces. Business is grinding to a halt.
Both happenings are strangely similar. They are, to borrow a phrase from financial theory, ¡°black swan¡± events: unexpected developments, coming out of nowhere, for which no one has any kind of contingency plan. And they are a warning about the fragility of the modern economy.
The lesson, surely, is to be aware of how easily whole industries can be blown apart. And to make sure we build systems robust enough to survive the worst that can be thrown at them. If the flight ban can teach us that, we should welcome it --even though thousands are stranded far from home.
The EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano has caused chaos on a massive scale. Since the April 14 eruption, more than 80,000 flights have been canceled. An easing of the cloud of ash, which can cause lethal damage to aircraft engines, meant that some European airports were starting to reopen yesterday. But London¡¯s Heathrow remained shut until late yesterday. And no one really knows how long the volcano will be a threat to the skies. Its last major eruption in 1821 lasted more than a year.
Air Dependence
It can teach us useful lessons, if we want to learn them.
First, we are dependent on air travel. Our economy is kept in motion by fleets of jetliners and a network of airports. Business revolves around meetings in hotels next to the runways. Documents are ferried around by air. Even the food in grocery stores often lands a day before from another continent.
But air networks are very delicate. They are constantly at the mercy of the weather, mechanical failure, labor strikes and terrorist plots. We should have learned after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington not to depend so much on flying. Likewise, we should listen more to the climate-change scientists warning about the impact of global warming. Perhaps the chaos of the last few days will teach us that our economy needs to be more grounded, both metaphorically and literally.
Distance Counts
Second, we forget that distance counts. Globalization has made the world seem a very small place. E-mails ping from continent to continent in the blink of an eye. Social networks allow us to be friends with people thousands of miles away as easily as if they lived in the next street. Money flashes from country to country, and ideas and trends zip around the world.
And yet, when the technology breaks down, it is a long way from Helsinki to Madrid, or from New York to Berlin. Try doing that journey the old-fashioned way -- by car, by boat, or on foot -- and you suddenly realize the distance between places still counts for a lot. The world isn¡¯t as much of a global village as we think it is. It¡¯s still a vast place, and the local can often bite back at the global.
Third, we need to prepare for the unexpected. A couple of years ago, it was the financial system that fell to pieces. Right now, it is the transport system. In both cases, the cause was something we didn¡¯t expect, or make any plans for. We thought hedge funds might blow up the banks -- instead some rather dull-looking mortgages did. We thought terrorists might spread chaos through the airline system -- it turned out that ash from an Icelandic volcano did that job.
¡®Black Swans¡¯
In reality, ¡°black swans¡± are everywhere. Much of Europe¡¯s energy is now supplied by Russia. Is that really stable in the long term? Much of our food is now genetically modified. What would happen if we suddenly discovered it wasn¡¯t safe anymore? The euro is a relatively new currency. It has struggled to cope with a few deficit issues in Greece, one of the smallest member states. There must be half a dozen different kinds of crises that could mean the money most of the continent relies on doesn¡¯t work anymore.
All sorts of unexpected events are lurking in the shadows. By definition, we haven¡¯t thought about them. It is because they are so unexpected that they are so dangerous. What we can do is think harder about the threats, get better at forecasting them, and find ways of making ourselves less vulnerable.
Air travel is useful. It is the quickest and usually the cheapest way of getting around. But we shouldn¡¯t depend on it as much as we do. We shouldn¡¯t rely so completely on any single network, whether it is financial or technological. That should be obvious to everyone. But sometimes it takes something as powerful as a volcanic eruption to make a simple point.

216,¡®Blade Runner¡¯ Pistorius on South Africa Squad for Track Worlds,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Oscar Pistorius will be the first amputee sprinter to compete at a world championship after being named in South Africa¡¯s squad for the event in South Korea.
The 24-year-old double amputee, known as ¡°the Blade Runner,¡± will be South Africa¡¯s sole participant in the 400-meter race and the 4x400 meter relay, according to a statement on his agent¡¯s website. The World Athletics Championships begin Aug. 27 in Daegu.
In July, Pistorius made the qualifying time for this year¡¯s championships and the 2012 London Olympics with a personal-best of 45.07 seconds in the 400 meters in a meet in Lignano, Italy. He had to run faster than 45.25 seconds.
¡°I have dreamt for such a long time of competing in a major championship and this is a very proud moment in my life,¡± Pistorius said on the website. ¡°It is an honor to be representing my country at such a prestigious event.¡±
Pistorius was born without fibulas and had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old.
In May 2008, the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned a ban on his competing against able-bodied athletes. The International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field¡¯s governing body, had ruled that his J-shaped carbon fiber blades gave him an advantage.
Caster Semenya, the 800-meter world champion, was also named to the South African squad. She was banned from competing for 11 months because of questions about her sex after she took the world title in Berlin two years ago.
Semenya set a season-best time of 1 minute 55.45 seconds with her victory at the 2009 championships, shortly after finding out that her gender had been questioned by the IAAF because of her muscular build and sudden improvement. She was cleared to compete in July 2010.

217,Future of TA-25¡¯s Worst Stock Just Got Grimmer as Tax Rise Looms,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
The outlook for the worst-performing stock on Israel¡¯s benchmark equity index this year just got even worse. Israel Chemicals Ltd. has been urging the government to defang a tax increase on its core business. On Tuesday the company learned its efforts so far had failed.
Israeli ministers approved recommendations by a government-appointed panel for a progressive windfall tax peaking at 42 percent on all quarried materials. Potash and phosphate fertilizers accounted for more than half the company¡¯s revenue last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The country¡¯s second-largest traded company with a market capitalization of 31 billion shekels ($8.1 billion) began shifting investments outside the country last year in response to the potential levy. Executives are still hoping the cabinet recommendation can be overturned. A lower tax will allow ICL ¡°to invest again in Israel,¡± a spokeswoman for the company, which is controlled by billionaire Idan Ofer, said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday.
The government recommendation came just days after Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., Israel Chemicals¡¯ second-largest shareholder, announced it may sell off its 14 percent stake in the company. Shares retreated 17.4 percent in the last six months as of the close of trading on Wednesday in Tel Aviv, trailing the average 6.8 percent decline of global peers, Bloomberg data shows.
The Potash Corp. sale, combined with an industrywide slump in commodity prices and the slim chance ICL can thwart the looming tax increase, could continue to depress the share price, according to Gilad Alper, senior analyst at Excellence Nessuah Brokerage Ltd. in Petach Tikva, Israel¡¯s third-largest investment house that manages 90 billion shekels.
Very Bleak
¡°Things look very bleak,¡± said Alper, who holds a market-perform rating on the stock. ¡°On the one hand, the popularity of anything to do with commodities and natural resources is falling. On the other hand, the government is doing everything it can to make ICL¡¯s life in Israel miserable.¡±
Israel¡¯s full cabinet and parliament still need to approve the tax reform before it becomes law. The panel, headed by emeritus economics professor Eytan Sheshinski, was appointed in response to public pressure over the profits of former state monopolies to ensure the treasury receives its due from the country¡¯s natural resources. If passed, the reform will take effect in January 2017.
In return for moderating the levy, the company has offered to invest 5 billion shekels in new factories, promising to boost employment in the country¡¯s struggling southern region. ICL¡¯s shares have fallen 14.8 percent so far this year, compared with a 17.7 percent rise in the TA-25 Index.
Given the circumstances, President and Chief Executive Officer Stefan Borgas has few good options to choose from, according to Alper.
¡°Management is doing exactly what it¡¯s supposed to do,¡± Alper said. ¡°Sheshinski is likely to be ratified and the company will have to continue to invest overseas and cut costs. Which is bad news for the country and, frankly, bad news for ICL.¡±"
218,"¡®Blind Pools¡¯ Falter as Ziman, Callahan Plan Comeback","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Feb. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Richard Ziman and Timothy Callahan want to raise money in the equity market after selling their real estate companies for a combined $12 billion before the property crash. Investors may balk at bankrolling their return.
Ziman, former chairman of Arden Realty Inc., and Callahan, who ran Trizec Properties Inc., have each filed to offer shares in so-called blind-pool companies, which seek to raise money before owning any assets. They plan to use proceeds from the deals to acquire discounted office properties, hoping their talent and track records will lure investors.
Their timing may be wrong. Recent blind-pool stock sales have been cut in size or canceled, or the shares are treading water, amid a slump in demand for initial public offerings. Meanwhile, real estate owners are trying to hold onto distressed or defaulted properties rather than unload them at fire-sale prices, leaving few buying opportunities.
¡°Blind pools have huge negatives and only make sense if they have the perfect management and the perfect opportunity,¡± Mike Kirby, chairman of Newport Beach, California-based Green Street Advisors Inc., a research firm focused on real estate investment trusts, said in an interview.
Almost $1 billion of commercial real estate-related IPOs registered as blind pools have been withdrawn or postponed in the past year through yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An additional $3.9 billion of deals are in the pipeline. Five of the seven blind pools that raised about $2 billion did so before October, the data show.
Terreno Flops
Terreno Realty Corp., a San Francisco-based fund formed to buy industrial properties, today said it had priced its IPO at $20 a share and would begin trading tomorrow. The company¡¯s original $200 million sale was postponed Jan. 25 after being reduced by a third, and was cut again yesterday by 13 percent.
Fairfield, New Jersey-based Chesapeake Lodging Trust raised 40 percent less than it sought, and the stock¡¯s total return including reinvested dividends is down 5.6 percent after its Jan. 22 debut. Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, based in Bethesda, Maryland, is up 0.3 percent since going public Dec. 8.
Blind pools are risky because ¡°the commercial market is in abysmal shape¡± and investors are worried the economic recovery will sputter amid high unemployment, said Robert Edelstein, a professor specializing in real estate at the University of California at Berkeley¡¯s Haas School of Business.
Unemployment Rate
The U.S. employment picture showed signs of improvement in January, with the jobless rate unexpectedly falling to 9.7 percent from 10 percent the previous month, the Commerce Department said Feb. 5. Unemployment touched a 26-year high of 10.1 percent in October.
Commercial real estate transactions declined 64 percent last year to $52 billion, data from researcher Real Capital Analytics Inc. show.
Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, fell to $12.2 billion in 2009 from a record $237 billion in 2007, removing a major source of financing for building owners, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, the second-largest U.S. bank. Delinquencies for loans packaged into CMBS rose to a record 6.5 percent in January from 1.5 percent a year earlier, Trepp LLC, a New York-based research firm, said Feb. 1.
Only 14 percent of an estimated $150 billion in distressed U.S. commercial real estate has been taken back by lenders, according to Jessica Ruderman, director of research services at New York-based Real Capital.
Real Estate ¡®Overhang¡¯
¡°There¡¯s an overhang of real estate that no one is quite sure what will happen with,¡± Edelstein said. ¡°The market is starting to recognize the complexities of owning troubled real estate.¡±
Some investors are betting on blind pools. Chesapeake Lodging may profit from the troubled hotel industry, said Jeffrey Kolitch, portfolio manager of the Baron Real Estate Fund in New York. Baron owned 9.8 percent of the REIT as of Jan. 21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
¡°Over the next few years, we believe there will be opportunities for well-capitalized companies such as Chesapeake to acquire hotels at attractive prices,¡± Kolitch said.
Ziman and Callahan sold their companies a year before the collapse of subprime residential mortgages led to the worst financial crisis since the 1930s and a more than 40 percent decline in commercial property values from their 2007 peak.
Arden Sale
Ziman, 67, was chairman of Arden Realty when Fairfield, Connecticut-based General Electric Co. agreed to buy it for $3.2 billion in December 2005. Arden, which Ziman founded in 1990, had 116 office properties with 18.5 million square feet in Southern California.
The Los Angeles-based company went public in October 1996 and returned 326 percent to shareholders, including dividends, through the announcement of the GE deal, according to a Dec. 18 IPO prospectus filed by Ziman¡¯s new company, Halvern Realty Inc. That compares with a 237 percent return by the MSCI US REIT Index.
Halvern, based in Los Angeles, is seeking to raise as much as $400 million, according to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company intends to buy and manage Southern California office properties and will be organized as a real estate investment trust. REITs must distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable income to shareholders, and don¡¯t pay corporate taxes on that amount.
Zell¡¯s CEO
Callahan, 59, was chief executive officer of Chicago-based Trizec Properties from 2002 until it was bought for about $9 billion by New York-based Brookfield Properties Corp. and Blackstone Group LP of New York in October 2006. He was CEO of billionaire Sam Zell¡¯s Equity Office Properties Trust, also in Chicago, from 1997 to 2002.
Under Callahan, Trizec returned 189 percent, compared with a 125 percent gain by the REIT Index, according to a Dec. 11 prospectus by his new company, Callahan Capital Properties Inc. Equity Office returned 89 percent while he was in charge, twice the rate of the index.
Callahan¡¯s REIT plans to buy prime office properties initially in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, according to its filing. The Chicago-based company may raise as much as $500 million in the IPO.
Ziman declined to comment, citing the so-called quiet period required before an IPO. Callahan didn¡¯t return calls seeking comment.
IPO Slump
The IPO market is slumping after the largest stock-market rally since the 1930s revived deals in the last four months of 2009 from a record slowdown that followed the credit crisis.
This year, Boca Raton, Florida-based FriendFinder Networks Inc.¡¯s $240 million initial offer and Los Angeles-based Imperial Capital Group Inc.¡¯s $113 million sale were pulled; Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc. cut its share price by 30 percent; and Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Patriot Risk Management Inc. delayed a $204 million deal.
The Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index has lost 3.8 percent in 2010, including dividends.
U.S. IPOs will triple in 2010 to $50 billion, according to an estimate by Barclays Plc, the second-largest U.K. bank. Even with a projected rise, real estate investors may favor trusts that already own buildings rather than blind pools, said Craig Guttenplan, a New York-based REIT analyst for CreditSights Inc.
¡°People are really wary of those,¡± Guttenplan said.
REIT Appeal
The load, or commission, for blind pools can reach 14 percent and covers underwriting and legal fees and general costs, according to Green Street Advisors¡¯ Kirby. Terreno had a 10 percent load, one reason the IPO didn¡¯t pass an ¡°economic merit¡± test, he said.
U.S. office REIT share prices are trading at 7 percent above the underlying value of their real estate and are a safer investment than blind pools, Kirby said.
Blind pools face competition from other investors. Private-equity managers raised $21.4 billion for 50 North America real estate funds last year, according to data compiled by Preqin Ltd., a London-based research firm. Barry Sternlicht¡¯s Starwood Capital Group LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, has $900 million in a hotel fund, managing director Marc Perrin said Nov. 6 at a real estate industry meeting.
The REIT boom that began two decades ago raised almost $27 billion in initial share sales from 1993 through 1998, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts in Washington. More than 150 real estate companies went public in that period, and ¡°few¡± of them were blind pools, said Michael Grupe, executive vice president for research.
Capital Raises
Last year, facing tight credit markets and needing to pay down debt, almost 90 existing REITs raised more than $21 billion in secondary share offerings, the most since 1997, NAREIT data show. Companies also raised more than $10 billion in unsecured debt.
Still, buildings aren¡¯t changing hands, and even established REITs can¡¯t find deals because owners expect values to rise following the government¡¯s massive support of capital markets, according to Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital.

219,¡®Bloated¡¯ London Banks Shrink in City as Europe Takes Aim,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- London¡¯s Square Mile is shrinking faster than any financial center in the world.
Having fired more employees than in any other country last year, the capital¡¯s banks are facing falling trading revenue, attacks from politicians to reduce pay and more job cuts. The U.K. government wants banks to split their consumer and investment banking units while European Union leaders are pushing to tax individual trades by the end of this year.
¡°We¡¯re going to end up with a smaller, more focused financial sector,¡± said Michael Kirkwood, 64, former head of Citigroup Inc.¡¯s U.K. division, who began his career in the Square Mile in 1965. ¡°The entire financial world became too bloated in the run up to the financial crisis, and London was excessively bloated.¡±
London, the world¡¯s biggest center for foreign-exchange trading, cross-border bank lending and interest-rate derivatives, is being squeezed by both the impact of the European sovereign-debt crisis on demand for its services and politicians who blame financiers for bringing the world economy to the brink of collapse. Banks are responding to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision¡¯s latest rules by exiting capital-intensive activities such as proprietary trading, putting at risk the U.K.¡¯s biggest exporting industry and 12 percent of its tax receipts.
RBS Cuts 3,500
¡°Most of the main sales and trading desks in Europe, Middle East and Africa are here,¡± said Philip Keevil, a former head of North American investment banking at S.G. Warburg & Co. and now a partner at New York-based advisory firm Compass Advisers LLP. ¡°Insofar as global banks have to make cuts in these areas because of Basel III and other regulations, then the cuts will be in London.¡±
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, which got the world¡¯s biggest bank bailout, said last week it will close its equities and corporate finance units, cutting as many as 3,500 jobs. The division is unprofitable and the bank will ¡°reduce in areas where capital intensity is high,¡± it said. RBS has already cut 30,000 jobs since it was bailed out by the government in 2008 and 2009, costing 45.5 billion pounds ($69.7 billion).
U.K. Cutbacks
U.K. financial-services firms eliminated 58,000 jobs last year, more than any other country in the world and 45 percent of the cutbacks announced by all western European banks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The numbers include worldwide cuts by U.K.-based financial companies such as HSBC Holdings Plc and exclude reductions in London by overseas banks such as Credit Suisse Group AG.
Employment for London¡¯s bankers dropped 8.5 percent last year compared with 2010 and over the next two years will remain below 1998 levels, according to the Centre for Economics & Business Research Ltd. U.S finance jobs dropped 1.7 percent in the same period, according to headhunting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., citing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The industry¡¯s contribution to U.K. gross domestic product shrank from 2009 to 2010, the first time in a decade, according to TheCityUK, a lobby group, which cited data from the Office of National Statistics. Financial services dropped to 8.9 percent of GDP in 2010, the latest data available, from 10.1 percent in 2009. That¡¯s still up from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2000.
¡°The whole industry needs to be consolidated and needs to be shrunk,¡± said John Mann, a Labour Party lawmaker. ¡°It¡¯s too powerful. That is to the huge detriment of the long-term sustainability of economic growth in this country.¡±
Tax Revenue Declines
The shrinking financial sector is lowering Britain¡¯s tax revenue, according to TheCityUK. Financial services paid 63 billion pounds in taxes last year, or 12 percent of total revenue, it said, citing data from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the City of London Corporation. That¡¯s down from 2007, when the industry contributed 14 percent of tax receipts.
Tax revenue is being squeezed because banks are making lower profits. Basel III¡¯s capital and liquidity rules will cut investment banks¡¯ return on equity to 7 percent from 20 percent, according to a report by New York-based McKinsey & Co. published in September. That will reduce profit after tax to $30 billion from $40 billion for the biggest 13 banks, it said.
¡°Institutions that aren¡¯t in the top positions in certain products will begin to exit those products,¡± said Giles Williams, head of KPMG LLP¡¯s financial-services regulatory center of excellence in London. ¡°Banks will focus on what they are good at and what they¡¯re famous for.¡±
Proprietary trading in fixed income, commodities and derivatives markets may be the worst affected by the extra capital requirements, Williams said.
UBS Cuts 2,000
¡°Trying to reduce the capital impact is clearly an aim for many of the banks,¡± said Ian Baggs, global banking and capital markets deputy leader at Ernst & Young LLP in London. Banks are focusing on achieving a high volume of trades with client money in markets such as interest-rate swaps rather than proprietary trading, which uses the bank¡¯s own money to take positions and carries a high regulatory capital requirement, he said.
UBS AG, hit by a $2.3 billion trading loss in London, announced a plan in November to shrink its investment bank to focus on wealth management at a cost of 2,000 jobs. It plans to exit asset securitization, complex structured products, macro-directional trading and equity proprietary trading. The investment bank¡¯s European headquarters is in London and it employs about 7,000 people in the U.K.
Smaller Stockbrokers
In the first quarter of last year, bank executives were planning to cut costs by 10 percent to 15 percent to boost return on equity targets, Ernst & Young¡¯s Baggs said. Now they¡¯re targeting 40 percent cost reductions, he said.
Clients¡¯ aversion to risk amid the turmoil in Europe is also squeezing equity trading desks and smaller stockbrokers in particular. Average trading volumes on the London Stock Exchange has remained below pre-crisis levels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Morgan Stanley¡¯s heads of European credit sales and trading, emerging market fixed-income sales and trading departed as well as two managing directors at its equities unit in London. Nomura Holdings Inc. is also scaling back its European expansion that began after the purchase of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.¡¯s European and Asian units in 2008.
Stockbrokers Evolution Group Plc, Merchant Securities Group Plc, Arbuthnot Securities Ltd. and Collins Stewart Hawkpoint Plc have all accepted takeover offers from larger competitors since the end of October.
Economic Forecasts Reduced
¡°For firms that have revenue falling off a cliff with a large cost base, the future is very bleak,¡± said Jamie Moyes, who worked in sales trading at London-based brokerage Liberum Capital Ltd. until September. ¡°The events of the market place are horrendous.¡± Moyes plans to help set up a stockbroking firm, starting with about six partners.
Aside from trading, equity capital markets and merger and acquisition advisory teams are also being slimmed down as a result of lower demand from corporate clients because of the European sovereign-debt crisis and worsening economic outlook.
The euro-region economy may expand 0.3 percent in 2012 instead of a previously forecast 1.3 percent, the European Central Bank said on Dec. 8. Some forecasters, including Morgan Stanley, project the region will shrink this year.
Firms in the U.K. raised 9.7 billion euros ($12.4 billion) through share sales last year compared with 24.9 billion euros in 2010 and 71.4 billion euros in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Bonuses Decline
The reduced corporate activity is affecting pay. Bonuses paid to the average London financial services worker for 2011 may shrink by about a fifth to 19,920 pounds, or 24 percent of their base salary, according to a survey by recruitment firm Astbury Marsden.
While London¡¯s banks have survived declines before, their profitability is under a fresh attack from international regulators. The European Commission, which drafts legislation for the European Union, has proposed a transaction tax of 0.1 percent on trading of stocks and bonds, and a 0.01 percent rate for derivatives contracts.
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne called the tax ¡°a bullet aimed at the heart of London¡± and estimates as much as 80 percent of the revenue raised will come from U.K. firms. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said last week he¡¯s willing to impose the levy unilaterally in an effort to spur other countries to join.
Transaction Tax
The European Commission estimates the tax on its own could raise 57 billion euros a year. That¡¯s optimistic because it excludes the impact of lower capital-gains tax revenue and gross domestic product, a study by Ernst & Young said this month.
The tax will increase transaction costs in the foreign-exchange market by three to seven times and by as much as 18 times for the most traded parts of the market, a study by Oliver Wyman commissioned by the Global Financial Markets Association said today.
U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron insists Britain can veto the EU tax, meaning countries within the 17-nation euro area may need to introduce the levy on their own. That may still put pressure on Britain should euro-region countries impose the tax on euro-denominated products.
Talking Tough
European parliamentarians have also suggested rules to force clearinghouses that handle euro-denominated securities to be based within the euro region, prompting the U.K. to sue the European Central Bank, saying the plan would compromise free markets. London is home to 40 percent of the world¡¯s over-the-counter derivatives trades and LCH Clearnet Group Ltd., Europe¡¯s biggest clearinghouse.
While defending London¡¯s financial interests in Europe, the U.K. government has been talking tough on the industry at home, where unemployment is at a 17-year high and the economy has struggled to grow following the financial crisis four years ago.
Cameron used his first speech of the New Year to pledge an end to bankers¡¯ ¡°excess¡± while Osborne said last week the industry should be a ¡°smaller slice¡± of the economy.
Cameron¡¯s government last year accepted proposals from the Independent Commission on Banking to force banks to insulate their consumer banking units while increasing capital requirements. Those recommendations will cost banks as much as 7 billion pounds annually to implement, the panel said.
Barclays, HSBC
Among the U.K. banks, the proposals will affect lenders with investment banking divisions the most and Lloyds Banking Group Plc the least because it is mainly a retail bank, according to analysts at HSBC Global Research on Jan. 10. HSBC, RBS and Barclays Plc all have investment banks.
London¡¯s decline puts its status as the world¡¯s premier financial center under threat from New York and Hong Kong, which are catching up, according to a survey of 1,887 executives by financial-services research firm Z/Yen, published in September. The survey asked about issues such as regulation, tax and lifestyle.
¡°London may not always be number one in the world, but it will still be a strong financial center,¡± said Mark Yeandle, Z/Yen¡¯s associate director in London. ¡°It¡¯s not going to fall out of the top five anytime soon.¡±
London¡¯s Advantages
London¡¯s strengths include its depth of expertise, time zone, language and legal infrastructure, according to Z/Yen. It is home to 241 foreign banks, more than in any other country, the biggest foreign-exchange market and the largest market for interest-rate derivatives, with $1.4 trillion of daily revenue, or 46 percent of the world¡¯s total, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
Ten years ago, London¡¯s bankers were dealing with the bursting of the dot-com bubble and were concerned the City would be left behind as Europe began trading its single currency. It went on to have its most profitable five years on record. This time, bankers say they¡¯re hoping history repeats itself.
The second half of 2011 ¡°was the worst I can remember in my career because we moved from a financial crisis to a sovereign-debt crisis,¡± said Robert James, an analyst of financial stocks at Aviva Plc who has worked in London for 22 years. ¡°Now the realization has dawned on the politicians that they have to do something about it. That has to be a good thing for 2012.¡±

220,"¡®Bloodgate¡¯ Doctor Admits She Cut Rugby Player¡¯s Lip, Sky Says","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Aug. 23 (Bloomberg) -- A doctor admitted she cut a rugby player¡¯s lip with a stitch-cutter after he faked injury in the so-called ¡°Bloodgate¡± scandal, Sky News reported.
Counsel for Wendy Chapman told a General Medical Council disciplinary hearing in northwest England that she cut Harlequins winger Tom Williams because the player wanted to demonstrate a real injury, Sky said.
Williams was seen on camera taking a blood capsule out of his sock and putting it in his mouth before being substituted in a Heineken Cup quarterfinal against Leinster in April 2009. His substitution for a so-called blood injury enabled a specialist kicker to return to the field.
Chapman could be struck off if found guilty of misconduct in connection with the incident, an allegation she denies.
Chapman wouldn¡¯t comment while the hearing was ongoing, Dawn Boyall -- a spokeswoman for the Medical Defence Union, the organization responsible for providing the doctor¡¯s legal assistance -- told Bloomberg News.

221,U.K. Army ¡®Unjustifiably¡¯ Shot Bloody Sunday Marchers,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
June 15 (Bloomberg) -- British soldiers unjustifiably shot and killed 13 civilians in Derry, Northern Ireland, in 1972, according to an official report published today into the massacre known as ¡°Bloody Sunday.¡±
The dead, all of them Catholics, were taking part in a civil rights march in the majority Protestant province when troops opened fire on Jan. 30 that year. Fourteen others were shot and wounded. The report found the order to fire shouldn¡¯t have been given and the victims were unarmed.
The events of ¡°Bloody Sunday¡± escalated the conflict in Northern Ireland between the nationalist Irish Republican Army and the British Army as well as Protestant paramilitary groups loyal to the U.K. Some 479 people were killed in the conflict in 1972, compared with 171 the year before.
¡°What happened on Bloody Sunday strengthened the IRA, increased nationalist resentment and hostility towards the army and exacerbated the violent conflict,¡± the Saville Inquiry, which heard evidence from 921 witnesses between 2000 and 2005, said in its report. ¡°It was a tragedy for the bereaved and the wounded, and a catastrophe for the people of Northern Ireland.¡±
The findings in the report may lead to the prosecution of the soldiers involved in the shootings and multimillion pound compensation claims for the victims¡¯ families, newspapers including the Sunday Times have reported.
Cameron Apology
U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said the decision on legal proceedings was one for the Director of Public Prosecutions, the country¡¯s senior prosecutor.
¡°It¡¯s important I don¡¯t say anything today that would prejudice either a criminal prosecution or a civil one should it be brought,¡± Cameron told parliament.
In his speech, Cameron apologized for the behavior of the soldiers and said standing up for the army doesn¡¯t mean ¡°defending the indefensible.¡±
¡°The conclusions of this report are absolutely clear,¡± Cameron, who came to power last month, told lawmakers in parliament in London. ¡°What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable.¡±
Thousands of people gathered in the Guildhall square in Derry, cheering just before the report was released at 3:30 p.m. U.K. time as relatives of some of the victims showed their thumbs up to the crowd. The shootings took place a 10 minute walk away in the Bogside area of the city.
¡®Whizzing¡¯ Bullets
¡°The bullets were whizzing all around us,¡± said Gerry Duddy, 53, whose brother, Jackie, was one of those killed. ¡°He was just 16 and for years afterwards I was very angry. After the murders people were queuing up in the streets in Derry to join the IRA. Bloody Sunday was responsible.¡±
The U.K. government agreed to hold the inquiry in 1998 as part of the peace deal that helped end the three-decade long conflict that began in 1969 and claimed 3,500 lives.
As part of the deal a power-sharing assembly was created and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA agreed, to pursue its goal of a united Ireland peacefully.
¡°Today¡¯s the day when truth has been set free,¡± Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said in Dublin today. The report will help ¡°heal gaping wounds,¡± he said. ¡°It¡¯s a short distance between the Bogside and Guildhall, but the journey that was completed today took 38 years.¡±
The Saville Inquiry, which has cost an estimated 190 million pounds ($280 million), rejected an official probe held in 1972, which said the British Army had been fired on first and some of the dead had been handling bombs and guns.
No Warning
The army fired the first shots and no warning was given by soldiers, the report led by Lord Saville found.
¡°All our people killed that day were innocent and for the authorities to deny that that was the case just alienated me from the state further,¡± said Michael McKinney, 58, whose 27 year-old brother, Willie, was killed by the U.K.¡¯s Parachute Regiment that day. ¡°The report has been a long-time coming, but this is an opportunity for the British to try to make amends.¡±
The U.S. State Department said in an e-mailed statement it hoped the publication of the report would help Northern Ireland¡¯s ¡°ongoing transformation from a turbulent past to a peaceful future.¡±
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA¡¯s former political wing, said the report consigned the previous inquiry to history and published the truth.
¡°They were unarmed, they posed no threat and they were completely innocent,¡± he said in a statement.

222,¡®Blue-Dog¡¯ Democrat McIntyre Fights to Keep House Seat,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Representative Mike McIntyre is campaigning on extending tax cuts for all income levels, repealing President Barack Obama¡¯s health-care law and blocking illegal immigration. Republicans respond with a familiar refrain: He¡¯s still a Democrat.
The eight-term North Carolina lawmaker, one of a dying breed of fiscally conservative ¡°Blue Dog Democrats,¡± is struggling to win re-election in a Republican-leaning district. McIntyre, 56, won by almost 8 percentage points two years ago as 52 other House Democrats were defeated. Republicans, who control the North Carolina legislature, redrew his district to make his re-election a tougher prospect this time.
McIntyre, formerly a small-town lawyer, has delivered federal assistance to his district¡¯s tobacco farmers, the state¡¯s port in Wilmington and coastal tourism. He helped enact a $10 billion buyout of tobacco farmers, financed by cigarette makers, to end crop-price supports.
Blue Dog Democrats numbered 53 before Republicans took control of the House after the 2010 election. Including three resignations, their ranks have dwindled to 24 in this session of Congress as the House became more politically polarized with 87 new Republican members. Like McIntyre, others in the coalition fighting for their political lives include Representatives Larry Kissell of North Carolina, John Barrow of Georgia, Leonard Boswell of Iowa and Jim Matheson of Utah.
¡®Predetermine the Outcome¡¯
¡°There is no doubt I am an underdog¡± because Republican legislators deliberately drew the district to benefit his challenger, state Senator David Rouzer, McIntyre said in an interview. State lawmakers ¡°tried to predetermine the outcome of this race.¡±
The legislature removed McIntyre¡¯s hometown of Lumberton from his district along with reliably Democratic areas of Wilmington.
Republican groups have spent more than $3 million to defeat McIntyre, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan Washington group that tracks political spending. Democratic groups have countered with $1.6 million to help McIntyre defend the seat, the center said.
Even if McIntyre wins a ninth term, Democrats are at risk of losing three other U.S. House seats in North Carolina, including Kissell¡¯s. Redistricting prompted two House Democrats from the state, Brad Miller and Heath Shuler, also a Blue Dog, to announce their retirements.
¡°North Carolina is one of the reasons why Democrats aren¡¯t in a position to take back the House,¡± said House political analyst David Wasserman, with the non-partisan Cook Political Report in Washington.
Race Ratings
Cook analysts rate Republican candidates as likely winners against Kissell and in the races for the two open Democratic seats. It rates McIntyre¡¯s race against Rouzer as a ¡°tossup.¡± In Georgia, Barrow¡¯s redrawn district that was stripped of heavily Democratic Savannah is said by the Cook report to ¡°lean Republican.¡±
¡°It¡¯s possible that there won¡¯t be any conservative southern Democrats in the House after this round of redistricting,¡± Wasserman said.
The North Carolina Legislature gave McIntyre¡¯s opponent an advantage when they added Republican-leaning Johnston County to the congressional district. That¡¯s Rouzer¡¯s turf, and makes up 23 percent of the redrawn district¡¯s electorate.
Rouzer, 40, in an interview at his Smithfield campaign office, questioned McIntyre¡¯s credentials as a fiscal conservative and emphasized the times his opponent voted with fellow Democrats.
Pelosi Issue
¡°On the social issues he votes with a lot of Republicans but that¡¯s about where it stops,¡± Rouzer said. He singled out McIntyre¡¯s backing of Californian Nancy Pelosi to be House speaker when Democrats controlled the chamber and the lawmaker¡¯s vote ¡°for the failed Obama stimulus,¡± referring to the $833 billion legislation passed during the president¡¯s first months in office.
In his television ads, McIntyre highlights Rouzer¡¯s career as a lobbyist, particularly for such overseas companies as Japan Tobacco. One ad accuses Rouzer of lobbying on behalf of legislation that would give ¡°amnesty¡± to ¡°illegal immigrants.¡±
In 2007, Rouzer lobbied for North Carolina¡¯s Mt. Olive Pickle Co. for legislation to expand immigration status for temporary farm workers. It would have given temporary farm workers a path to permanent residency.
Rouzer says the legislation, which wasn¡¯t enacted, would have helped North Carolina farmers who need inexpensive, willing labor.
Abortion Rights
Often allied with Republicans on taxes, spending and social issues such as opposing abortion rights, McIntyre disputes as ¡°laughable¡± Rouzer¡¯s assertion that he marches in political lockstep with Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. That may be a hard sell for McIntyre in Johnston County, where Obama won less than 40 percent of the vote in 2008.
Independence from the national party is a necessary survival skill for rural Southern Democrats like McIntyre and Barrow, said Merle Black, a political scientist who specializes in southern politics at Atlanta¡¯s Emory University.
Obama and Pelosi ¡°are liberal Democrats all the way and that¡¯s a non-starter in a lot of the rural small towns,¡± Black said.
Not Endorsed Obama
An opponent of the 2010 health-care law who voted with Republicans to repeal it, McIntyre hasn¡¯t endorsed Obama¡¯s re-election, though he would benefit from turnout for the president among Democratic voters.
¡°I have not gotten into other people¡¯s races and I am not going to,¡± McIntyre said. His endorsement of Obama four years ago was made at a different time, he said, when the presidency ¡°was an open seat.¡±
McIntyre stresses his political independence, which enables him to work with Republicans and Democrats to help his district get federal money to build veterans¡¯ health clinics, replenish sand on eroded beaches and support rural development.
¡°My voting record has been consistently down the middle,¡± McIntyre said. ¡°That leads to success here at home.¡±
McIntyre also opposed the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul and a House-passed measure to curb air pollution that contributes to climate change.
He is one of five House Democrats endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobby that mostly supports Republicans, also backs McIntyre.
Tax Cut
¡°I have never met a tax cut I didn¡¯t like,¡± he said, by way of explaining the business support for him.
He backs continuing the expiring George W. Bush-era tax cuts for all income groups, including top earners. That puts him at odds with Obama and most Democrats who favor ending the tax cuts for married couples with income exceeding $250,000 a year and for individuals making more than $200,000 annually.
The depletion of the Blue Dog ranks ¡°eliminates those voices from the Democratic caucus¡± who are willing to break from the party line, said Ferrel Guillory, who teaches journalism at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. It also undercuts centrist views on the other side of the political aisle, he said, because ¡°Rouzer and those like him are not moderate Republicans.¡±

223,Lesbian Drama Triumphs at Cannes as Douglas Wins Nothing,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 27 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°Blue Is the Warmest Colour,¡± a graphic lesbian love story directed by Abdellatif Kechiche, won the Palme d¡¯Or at this year¡¯s Cannes Film Festival, where Steven Spielberg headed the jury.
The runner-up Grand Prix went to Joel Coen and Ethan Coen¡¯s ¡°Inside Llewyn Davis,¡± with Justin Timberlake. And in the best-actor category, Michael Douglas -- who played the eccentric pianist Liberace in Steven Soderbergh¡¯s ¡°Behind the Candelabra¡± -- lost out to Bruce Dern, the wandering old man in Alexander Payne¡¯s ¡°Nebraska.¡±
Critics adored the winning movie, known in French as ¡°La Vie D¡¯Adele -- Chapitre 1 & 2.¡± Three hours long, the film is about a 15-year-old girl whose life is transformed when she meets a young woman with short blue hair. Spielberg, announcing the Palme d¡¯Or winner on stage at the closing ceremony, said it also went to actresses Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos.
Stepping up to the microphone, the film¡¯s French-Tunisian director dedicated his prize ¡°to the great youth of France, who I met during the lengthy shoot, and who taught me a great deal about the spirit of freedom and togetherness.¡±
He also dedicated it to the rebellious youth of Tunisia -- instigators of the Arab Spring -- ¡°for their aspiration to live freely, express themselves freely, and love freely.¡±
Founded in 1946 in the French Riviera resort, Cannes is the world¡¯s leading film festival. Orson Welles, Luis Bunuel, and Ingmar Bergman were early winners. The festival is both a venue for splashy Hollywood-movie premieres and a springboard for low-budget international titles; 4,000 journalists cover it.
Best Actress
The best-actress award went to France¡¯s Berenice Bejo (the dancing ingenue in ¡°The Artist¡±) for her role as a reality-bitten divorcee in Asghar Farhadi¡¯s ¡°The Past.¡± Set in the Paris suburbs, the film contrasts with Farhadi¡¯s previous work, Oscar-winning ¡°A Separation,¡± which took place in Tehran.
The evening¡¯s other loser was Italy¡¯s Paolo Sorrentino, whose ¡°The Great Beauty¡± was a sarcastic Fellinian reverie set in 21st-century Rome -- a city of coke, cardinals, and Botox -- with actor Toni Servillo the world-weary protagonist.
As best director, the jury recognized Amat Escalante, director of the violent Mexican movie ¡°Heli.¡±
¡°A Touch of Sin¡± by Zhangke Jia took the award for best script with its depiction of China.
Gay love appeared in more than one movie at this year¡¯s festival -- even as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Paris yesterday to protest the recent legalization of gay marriage.
Soderbergh¡¯s ¡°Candelabra¡± had Douglas, a.k.a. Liberace, and his much younger lover Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) kissing and sharing tubs and beds. ¡°Stranger by the Lake,¡± a French movie directed by Alain Guiraudie, showed one man falling dangerously in love with another he met at a lakeside cruising spot; there was graphic sex there, too.
Tepid Gatsby
The festival started with a splashy red-carpet premiere for Baz Luhrmann¡¯s ¡°The Great Gatsby,¡± which had received tepid reviews during its North American debut five days earlier.
Actor Leonardo DiCaprio took the opportunity to boast of the movie¡¯s $51 million in opening-weekend box office sales. Hours later, he joined revelers at an exclusive party in a mega-tent that featured live performances by Bryan Ferry and Florence Welch (of Florence + the Machine).
Riviera Robbery
Otherwise, Cannes this year offered a new kind of offscreen action. No sooner had director Sofia Coppola screened her movie about teenage burglars in Hollywood (¡°The Bling Ring¡±) than real-life robbers, as if on cue, started fanning out across the French Riviera.
One set of thieves stole an estimated 1 million euros ($1.3 million) in jewelry from a hotel safe in central Cannes. The gems from the house of Chopard were for stars to borrow and wear on the red carpet. Chopard also happens to be the designer of the Palme d¡¯Or.
Days later, a 2 million euro diamond necklace, loaned to a wearer for a gala at the exclusive Hotel du Cap, vanished overnight from a guarded area of the hotel. Geneva-based jeweler De Grisogono issued a brief statement reporting the loss.
Muse highlights include Guy Collins and John Mariani on wine, Scott Reyburn and Frederik Balfour on the art market, Farah Nayeri on film and Gwen Ackerman on Israel art.

225,¡®Bonnie and Clyde¡¯ Makes Folk Heroes of Killers: Jeremy Gerard,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
Dec. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker had little to recommend them as citizens worthy of a Broadway musical. They killed anyone who got in their way during a bank-robbing spree around the Midwest in the heart of the Great Depression.
We can¡¯t all be Mary Poppins. Frank Wildhorn¡¯s ¡°Bonnie and Clyde,¡± which opened Thursday night on Broadway, has catchy songs, a fleshed out story and plenty of heart thanks to the snazzy direction by Jeff Calhoun and a design team that invokes the period in broad but astute strokes.
It also has a pair of stars in Jeremy Jordan (Clyde) and Laura Osnes (Bonnie). Avoid the temptation to revisit Arthur Penn¡¯s 1967 movie with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, and you¡¯ll have a fine time.
That¡¯s high praise for Wildhorn (last season¡¯s short-lived ¡°Wonderland,¡± ¡°Jekyll and Hyde¡±), whose predilection for generic-sounding pop tunes with a high dose of treacle hasn¡¯t won him many fans among critics. While it falls into some of the same traps, ¡°Bonnie and Clyde¡± is by far his best score.
Wildhorn and his collaborators -- book writer Ivan Menchell and lyricist Don Black -- smartly dispense with the film¡¯s violent finale right off the bat: The lights go down, the air fills with smoke and the sound of machine-gun fire, and the curtains part revealing a shot up Ford and the bullet-riddled bodies of the murderous pair.
Doing Time
With that business out of the way, they can settle in to some conventional storytelling. How young Clyde was raising hell (and doing time) from boyhood and young Bonnie dreamed of being the next Clara Bow, the ¡°It¡± girl.
People are losing their homes and even the banks are running out of cash. Clyde comes upon Bonnie in West Dallas and sweet talks her into running off with him as they begin life on the lam.
Three days after seeing it, I can¡¯t recall a single tune from the show (a little lower on the volume might have helped me listen better). One line of Clyde¡¯s, however, has stayed with me. When his sister-in-law urges him to turn himself in and finish his prison sentence, Clyde responds, ¡°I am never going to be set free. Freedom is something I gotta steal.¡±
Unlikely Somebodies
Jordan, fresh from starring in the Broadway-bound ¡°Newsies,¡± resembles Leonardo DiCaprio. His singing is strong and sure, but I liked his slouchy acting even better. He does a fine job of conveying Clyde¡¯s transformation from goofy nobody to unlikely somebody. During one bank holdup, a trembling customer asks for his autograph, and he cheerfully obliges.
Osnes, who spends a good deal of the show in a slip, effectively belts the 11 o¡¯clock number, ¡°Dyin¡¯ Ain¡¯t So Bad,¡± without making it memorable.
As Clyde¡¯s helpful brother and reluctant sister-in-law, Claybourne Elder and Melissa Van Der Schyff offer powerful vocal and dramatic support.
There¡¯s no dancing to speak of, which I suppose is indicative of the show¡¯s seriousness of purpose. That¡¯s also reflected in Tobin Ost¡¯s settings, rough-hewn barn siding jazzed with Aaron Rhyne¡¯s projections of sensationalist newspaper headlines and mug shots, all sympathetically lit by Michael Gilliam, often through a Dust Bowl haze. A pop romance about the American nightmare, ¡°Bonnie and Clyde¡± is solidly entertaining.

¡®Angel Reapers¡¯
The stage of the Joyce Theater is bare but for a dozen wooden chairs, soon occupied by a gathering of primly dressed men and women. When they begin singing ¡°¡¯Tis a Gift to be Simple,¡± it¡¯s almost impossible not to think of Martha Graham and ¡°Appalachian Spring.¡±
¡°Angel Reapers¡± is the work of a different Martha, in this case the choreographer and director Martha Clarke, collaborating with playwright Alfred Uhry (¡°Driving Miss Daisy¡±). The story, such as it is in this 70-minute dance, concerns the 18th-century Shaker movement, with its odd mix of ecstatic mysticism and celibacy.
That familiar song devolves into foot-stomping and, eventually the dancers whirling like dervishes, stripping off their clothes and behaving in decidedly non-celibate fashion. As always with Clarke (¡°Vienna: Lusthaus¡±), the images are striking, even if we¡¯re left pondering the meaning of it all.

226,"¡®Book of Mormon,¡¯ ¡®Scottsboro¡¯ Garner Most Tony Nominations","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Google+ E-mail
May 3 (Bloomberg) -- ¡°The Book of Mormon,¡± the scabrous musical from the creators of ¡°South Park¡± and ¡°Avenue Q,¡± won 14 Tony nominations, the most of any production this year. The shows that will compete for Broadway¡¯s top honors were announced this morning in New York.
¡°Jerusalem,¡± Jez Butterworth¡¯s comic drama about a former daredevil biker whose bosky trailer-home is a drugs-and-alcohol-infused refuge in the English countryside, won six nominations. They included best play and lead actor, Mark Rylance.
A revival of Shakespeare¡¯s ¡°The Merchant of Venice,¡± starring a feral Al Pacino as the moneylender Shylock, took seven nominations, the most of any play, including a best performance nod for its star.
Four more high-profile actors taking the stage this season -- comedians Robin Williams and Chris Rock, James Earl Jones and ¡°Harry Potter¡± star Daniel Radcliffe -- were snubbed by the nominating committee.
¡°Mormon¡± follows the misadventures of two young church missionaries in Africa. The actors in those parts, Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells, were nominated. In addition, ¡°Mormon¡± was nominated for best book, score, director, featured performance by an actor and actress, choreographer, set, costumes, sound and lighting design, and orchestrations.
Final Show
The other best-musical nominees are ¡°Catch Me If You Can,¡± ¡°Sister Act¡± and ¡°The Scottsboro Boys,¡± which closed in the fall. The final show by the ¡°Chicago¡± and ¡°Cabaret¡± team of John Kander and Fred Ebb, ¡°Scottsboro¡± received 12 nominations, the second-most after ¡°Mormon.¡±
Competing for best play are ¡°Good People,¡± ¡°The Motherf**ker With the Hat¡± and ¡°War Horse,¡± an import from England¡¯s National Theatre.
Pacino and Rylance will vie for the best-actor award with Brian Bedford, Bobby Cannavale and Joe Mantello. The latter stars in a late-season production of Larry Kramer¡¯s 1985 AIDS drama, ¡°The Normal Heart,¡± which has become one of the year¡¯s most-acclaimed shows.
The other nominees for best play revival are ¡°Arcadia,¡± ¡°The Importance of Being Earnest¡± and ¡°Merchant.¡±
The nominees for best actress are Vanessa Redgrave, Jones¡¯s co-star in a revival of ¡°Driving Miss Daisy¡±; Frances McDormand, Lily Rabe and Hannah Yelland.
¡®Anything Goes¡¯
Cole Porter¡¯s 1934 ¡°Anything Goes,¡± presented by the Roundabout Theatre Company, was nominated for nine awards, including best revival of a musical and best actress for its star, Sutton Foster. Its only competition will be Frank Loesser¡¯s 1961 spoof of the business world, which presented Radcliffe in his first Broadway role as a song-and-dance man.
Notably absent from the announcement was any mention of the season¡¯s most talked about, most reported on and, by most critics¡¯ accounts, most misbegotten musical, the $70 million ¡°Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.¡± That show is currently being revamped for an announced June 14 opening after several postponements.
The nominations were voted by a committee of 26 people, including actors Andre de Shields and Alice Playten, director Michael Greif and theater historian Robert Kimball.
The Tony Awards are co-produced by the Broadway League, a trade organization of producers and theater owners, and the American Theatre Wing, a service group. The approximately 750 voters include members of the League, representatives from the Wing, Broadway unions representing actors, directors, writers, designers and offstage personnel, as well as members of the New York Drama Critics¡¯ Circle.
CBS will telecast the 65th annual Tony Awards on Sunday, June 12 from 8 to 11 p.m. New York time.
